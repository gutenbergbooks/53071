<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mark, the Match Boy</span>," is the third volume of the "Ragged
Dick Series," and, like its predecessors, aims to describe a special
phase of street life in New York. While it is complete in itself,
several characters are introduced who have figured conspicuously in the
preceding volumes; and the curiosity as to their future history, which
has been expressed by many young readers, will be found to be gratified
in the present volume.</p>

<p>The author has observed with pleasure the increased
public attention which has been drawn to
the condition of these little waifs of city life, by
articles in our leading magazines, and in other ways;
and hopes that the result will be to strengthen and
assist the philanthropic efforts which are making to
rescue them from their vagabond condition, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>

train them up to be useful members of society. That
his own efforts have been received with so large a
measure of public favor, not limited to the young
readers for whom the series is especially written, the
author desires to express his grateful thanks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">RICHARD HUNTER AT HOME.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">"Fosdick,"</span></span> said Richard Hunter, "what was
the name of that man who owed your father two
thousand dollars, which he never paid him?"</p>

<p>"Hiram Bates," answered Fosdick, in some surprise.
"What made you think of him?"</p>

<p>"I thought I remembered the name. He
moved out West, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"So I heard at the time."</p>

<p>"Do you happen to remember where? Out
West is a very large place."</p>

<p>"I do not know exactly, but I think it was Milwaukie."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Richard Hunter, in visible

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>

excitement. "Well, Fosdick, why don't you try to
get the debt paid?"</p>

<p>"Of what use would it be? How do I know he
is living in Milkwaukie now? If I should write him
a letter, there isn't much chance of my ever getting
an answer."</p>

<p>"Call and see him."</p>

<p>"What, go out to Milwaukie on such a wild-goose
chase as that? I can't think what you are driving
at, Dick."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you, Fosdick. Hiram Bates is
now in New York."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Fosdick, with an
expression of mingled amazement and incredulity.</p>

<p>"I'll show you."</p>

<p>Richard Hunter pointed to the list of hotel arrivals
in the "Evening Express," which he held in his
hand. Among the arrivals at the Astor House
occurred the name of Hiram Bates, from Milwaukie.</p>

<p>"If I am not mistaken," he said, "that is the
name of your father's debtor."</p>

<p>"I don't know but you are right," said Fosdick,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"He must be prosperous if he stops at a high-priced
hotel like the Astor."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. How much good that
money would have done my poor father," he added,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"How much good it will do you, Fosdick."</p>

<p>Fosdick shook his head. "I would sell out my
chance of getting it for ten dollars," he said.</p>

<p>"I would buy it at that price if I wanted to make
money out of you; but I don't. I advise you to
attend to this matter at once."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" asked Fosdick, who seemed
at a loss to understand his companion's meaning.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing to do," said Dick,
promptly. "Call on Mr. Bates this evening at the
hotel. Tell him who you are, and hint that you
should like the money."</p>

<p>"I haven't got your confidence, Dick. I shouldn't
know how to go about it. Do you really think it
would do any good? He might think I was impertinent."</p>

<p>"Impertinent to ask payment of a just debt! I
don't see it in that light. I think I shall have to go
with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you would,&mdash;that is, if you really think
there is any use in going."</p>

<p>"You mustn't be so bashful if you want to get
on in the world, Fosdick. As long as there's a
chance of getting even a part of it, I advise you to
make the attempt."</p>

<p>"Well, Dick, I'll be guided by your advice."</p>

<p>"Two thousand dollars would be a pretty good
windfall for you."</p>

<p>"That's true enough, considering that I only get
eight dollars a week."</p>

<p>"I wish you got more."</p>

<p>"So do I, for one particular reason."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel satisfied to have you pay ten dollars
a week towards our board, while I pay only six."</p>

<p>"Didn't you promise not to say anything more
about that?" said Dick, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"But I can't help <i>thinking</i> about it. If we had
stayed at our old boarding-house in Bleecker Street,
I could have paid my full share."</p>

<p>"But this is a nicer room."</p>

<p>"Much nicer. If I only paid my half, I should
be glad of the chance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I'll promise you one thing. If Mr.
Bates pays you the two thousand dollars, you may
pay your half of the expense."</p>

<p>"Not much chance of that, Dick."</p>

<p>"We can tell better after calling at the Astor
House. Get on your coat and we'll start."</p>

<p>While the boys,&mdash;for the elder of the two is but eighteen&mdash;are making
preparations to go out, a few explanations may be required by the
reader. Those who have read "Ragged Dick" and "Fame and Fortune,"&mdash;the
preceding volumes of this series,&mdash;will understand that less than three
years before Richard Hunter was an ignorant and ragged boot-black about
the streets, and Fosdick, though possessing a better education, was
in the same business. By a series of upward steps, partly due to good
fortune, but largely to his own determination to improve, and hopeful
energy, Dick had now become a book-keeper in the establishment of
Rockwell &amp; Cooper, on Pearl Street, and possessed the confidence and
good wishes of the firm in a high degree.</p>

<p>Fosdick was two years younger, and, though an
excellent boy, was less confident, and not so well
fitted as his friend to contend with the difficulties of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>

life, and fight his way upward. He was employed
in Henderson's hat and cap store on Broadway, and
was at present earning a salary of eight dollars a
week. As the two paid sixteen dollars weekly for
their board, Fosdick would have had nothing left if
he had paid his full share. But Richard Hunter at
first insisted on paying eleven dollars out of the sixteen,
leaving his friend but five to pay. To this
Fosdick would not agree, and was with difficulty
prevailed upon at last to allow Richard to pay ten;
but he had always felt a delicacy about this, although
he well knew how gladly his friend did it.</p>

<p>The room which they now occupied was situated
in St. Mark's Place, which forms the eastern portion
of Eighth Street. It was a front room on the
third floor, and was handsomely furnished. There
was a thick carpet, of tasteful figure, on the floor.
Between the two front windows was a handsome
bureau, surmounted by a large mirror. There was
a comfortable sofa, chairs covered with hair-cloth, a
centre-table covered with books, crimson curtains,
which gave a warm and cosey look to the room when
lighted up in the evening, and all the accessories of
a well-furnished room which is used at the same

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>

time as parlor and chamber. This, with an excellent
table, afforded a very agreeable home to the boys,&mdash;a
home which, in these days, would cost considerably
more, but for which, at the time of which I write,
sixteen dollars was a fair price.</p>

<p>It may be thought that, considering how recently
Richard Hunter had been a ragged boot-black, content
to sleep in boxes and sheltered doorways, and
live at the cheapest restaurants, he had become very
luxurious in his tastes. Why did he not get a
cheaper boarding-place, and save up the difference in
price? No doubt this consideration will readily
suggest itself to the minds of some of my young
readers.</p>

<p>As Richard Hunter had a philosophy of his own
on this subject, I may as well explain it here. He
had observed that those young men who out of economy
contented themselves with small and cheerless
rooms, in which there was no provision for a fire,
were driven in the evening to the streets, theatres,
and hotels, for the comfort which they could not find
at home. Here they felt obliged to spend money to
an extent of which they probably were not themselves
fully aware; and in the end wasted considerably

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>

more than the two or three dollars a week extra
which would have provided them with a comfortable
home. But this was not all. In the roamings
spent outside many laid the foundation of wrong
habits, which eventually led to ruin or shortened
their lives. They lost all the chances of improvement
which they might have secured by study at
home in the long winter evenings, and which in the
end might have qualified them for posts of higher
responsibility, and with a larger compensation.</p>

<p>Richard Hunter was ambitious. He wanted to rise to an honorable place
in the community, and he meant to earn it by hard study. So Fosdick
and he were in the habit of spending a portion of every evening in
improving reading or study. Occasionally he went to some place of
amusement, but he enjoyed thoroughly the many evenings when, before a
cheerful fire, with books in their hands, his room-mate and himself
were adding to their stock of knowledge. The boys had for over a year
taken lessons in French and mathematics, and were now able to read the
French language with considerable ease.</p>

<p>"What's the use of moping every evening in your

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

room?" asked a young clerk who occupied a hall
bedroom adjoining.</p>

<p>"I don't call it moping. I enjoy it," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"You don't go to a place of amusement once a
month."</p>

<p>"I go as often as I like."</p>

<p>"Well, you're a queer chap. You pay such a
thundering price for board. You could go to the
theatre four times a week without its costing you
any more, if you would take a room like mine."</p>

<p>"I know it; but I'd rather have a nice, comfortable
room to come home to."</p>

<p>"Are you studying for a college professor?"
asked the other, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Dick, good-humoredly;
"but I'm open to proposals, as the oyster remarked.
If you know any first-class institution that would
like a dignified professor, of extensive acquirements,
just mention me, will you?"</p>

<p>So Richard Hunter kept on his way, indifferent to
the criticisms which his conduct excited in the minds
of young men of his own age. He looked farther
than they, and knew that if he wanted to succeed in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>

life, and win the respect of his fellow-men, he must
do something else than attend theatres, and spend his
evenings in billiard saloons. Fosdick, who was a
quiet, studious boy, fully agreed with his friend in
his views of life, and by his companionship did much
to strengthen and confirm Richard in his resolution.
He was less ambitious than Dick, and perhaps loved
study more for its own sake.</p>

<p>With these explanations we shall now be able to
start fairly in our story.</p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">The</span></span> two friends started from their room about
seven o'clock, and walked up to Third Avenue,
where they jumped on board a horse-car, and within
half an hour were landed at the foot of the City Hall
Park, opposite Beekman Street. From this point it
was necessary only to cross the street to the Astor
House.</p>

<p>The Astor House is a massive pile of gray stone,
and has a solid look, as if it might stand for hundreds
of years. When it was first erected, a little more
than thirty years since, it was considered far up
town, but now it is far down town, so rapid has been
the growth of the city.</p>

<p>Richard Hunter ascended the stone steps with a
firm step, but Henry Fosdick lingered behind.</p>

<p>"Do you think we had better go up, Dick?" he
said irresolutely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I feel awkward about it."</p>

<p>"There is no reason why you should. The
money belongs to you rightfully, as the representative
of your father, and it is worth trying
for."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right, but I shan't know
what to say."</p>

<p>"I'll help you along if I find you need it. Come
along."</p>

<p>Those who possess energy and a strong will generally
gain their point, and it was so with Richard
Hunter. They entered the hotel, and, ascending
some stone steps, found themselves on the main floor,
where the reading-room, clerk's office, and dining-room
are located.</p>

<p>Dick, to adopt the familiar name by which his
companion addressed him, stepped up to the desk,
and drew towards him the book of arrivals. After
a brief search he found the name of "Hiram Bates,
Milwaukie, Wis.," towards the top of the left-hand
page.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Bates in?" he inquired of the clerk,
pointing to the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will send and inquire, if you will write your
name on this card."</p>

<p>Dick thought it would be best to send his own
name, as that of Fosdick might lead Mr. Bates
to guess the business on which they had come.</p>

<p>He accordingly wrote the name,</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/signature.jpg" alt="Richard Hunter" />
</div>

<p>in his handsomest handwriting, and handed it to the
clerk.</p>

<p>That functionary touched a bell. The summons
was answered by a servant.</p>

<p>"James, go to No. 147, and see if Mr. Bates is
in. If he is, give him this card."</p>

<p>The messenger departed at once, and returned
quickly.</p>

<p>"The gentleman is in, and would be glad to have
Mr. Hunter walk up."</p>

<p>"Come along, Fosdick," said Dick, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Fosdick obeyed, feeling very nervous. Following
the servant upstairs, they soon stood before
No. 147.</p>

<p>James knocked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in," was heard from the inside, and the
two friends entered.</p>

<p>They found themselves in a comfortably furnished
room. A man of fifty-five, rather stout in build,
and with iron-gray hair, rose from his chair before
the fire, and looked rather inquiringly. He seemed
rather surprised to find that there were two visitors,
as well as at the evident youth of both.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunter?" he said, inquiringly, looking
from one to the other.</p>

<p>"That is my name," said Dick, promptly.</p>

<p>"Have I met you before? If so, my memory is
at fault."</p>

<p>"No, sir, we have never met."</p>

<p>"I presume you have business with me. Be
seated, if you please."</p>

<p>"First," said Dick, "let me introduce my friend
Henry Fosdick."</p>

<p>"Fosdick!" repeated Hiram Bates, with a slight
tinge of color.</p>

<p>"I think you knew my father," said Fosdick,
nervously.</p>

<p>"Your father was a printer,&mdash;was he not?" inquired
Mr. Bates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I do remember him. Do you come from
him?"</p>

<p>Fosdick shook his head.</p>

<p>"He has been dead for two years," he said,
sadly.</p>

<p>"Dead!" repeated Hiram Bates, as if shocked.
"Indeed, I am sorry to hear it."</p>

<p>He spoke with evident regret, and Henry Fosdick,
whose feelings towards his father's debtor had not
been very friendly, noticed this, and was softened
by it.</p>

<p>"Did he die in poverty, may I ask?" inquired
Mr. Bates, after a pause.</p>

<p>"He was poor," said Fosdick; "that is, he had
nothing laid up; but his wages were enough to support
him and myself comfortably."</p>

<p>"Did he have any other family?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; my mother died six years since, and I
had no brothers or sisters."</p>

<p>"He left no property then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose he was able to make no provision
for you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"But you probably had some relatives who came
forward and provided for you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I had no relatives in New York."</p>

<p>"What then did you do? Excuse my questions,
but I have a motive in asking."</p>

<p>"My father died suddenly, having fallen from a
Brooklyn ferry-boat and drowned. He left nothing,
and I knew of nothing better to do than to go into
the streets as a boot-black."</p>

<p>"Surely you are not in that business now?"
said Mr. Bates, glancing at Fosdick's neat dress.</p>

<p>"No, sir; I was fortunate enough to find a
friend,"&mdash;here Fosdick glanced at Dick,&mdash;"who
helped me along, and encouraged me to apply for a
place in a Broadway store. I have been there now for
a year and a half."</p>

<p>"What wages do you get? Excuse my curiosity,
but your story interests me."</p>

<p>"Eight dollars a week."</p>

<p>"And do you find you can live comfortably on
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; that is, with the assistance of my
friend here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad you have a friend who is able and
willing to help you."</p>

<p>"It is not worth mentioning," said Dick, modestly.
"I have received as much help from him as
he has from me."</p>

<p>"I see at any rate that you are good friends, and
a good friend is worth having. May I ask, Mr. Fosdick,
whether you ever heard your father refer to me
in any way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You are aware, then, that there were some
money arrangements between us?"</p>

<p>"I have heard him say that you had two thousand
dollars of his, but that you failed, and that it was
lost."</p>

<p>"He informed you rightly. I will tell you
the particulars, if you are not already aware
of them."</p>

<p>"I should be very glad to hear them, sir. My
father died so suddenly that I never knew anything
more than that you owed him two thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Five years since," commenced Mr. Bates, "I
was a broker in Wall Street. As from my business

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>

I was expected to know the best investments, some
persons brought me money to keep for them, and I
either agreed to pay them a certain rate of interest,
or gave them an interest in my speculations.
Among the persons was your father. The way
in which I got acquainted with him was this:
Having occasion to get some prospectuses of a new
company printed, I went to the office with which he
was connected. There was some error in the printing,
and he was sent to my office to speak with me
about it. When our business was concluded, he
waited a moment, and then said, 'Mr. Bates, I have
saved up two thousand dollars in the last ten years,
but I don't know much about investments, and I
should consider it a favor if you would advise
me.'</p>

<p>"'I will do so with pleasure,' I said. 'If you
desire it I will take charge of it for you, and either
allow you six per cent, interest, or give you a share
of the profits I may make from investing it.'"</p>

<p>"Your father said that he should be glad to have
me take the money for him, but he would prefer regular
interest to uncertain profits. The next day he
brought the money, and put it in my hands. To

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>

confess the truth I was glad to have him do so, for I
was engaged in extensive speculations, and thought I
could make use of it to advantage. For a year I paid
him the interest regularly. Then there came a great
catastrophe, and I found my brilliant speculations
were but bubbles, which broke and left me but a
mere pittance, instead of the hundred thousand dollars
which I considered myself worth. Of course
those who had placed money in my hands suffered, and
among them your father. I confess that I regretted
his loss as much as that of any one, for I liked his
straightforward manner, and was touched by his evident
confidence in me."</p>

<p>Mr. Bates paused a moment and then resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I left New York, and went to Milwaukie. Here
I was obliged to begin life anew, or nearly so, for I
only carried a thousand dollars out with me. But I
have been greatly prospered since then. I took
warning by my past failures, and have succeeded, by
care and good fortune, in accumulating nearly as
large a fortune as the one of which I once thought
myself possessed. When fortune began to smile upon
me I thought of your father, and tried through an
agent to find him out. But he reported to me that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>

his name was not to be found either in the New York
or Brooklyn Directory, and I was too busily engaged
to come on myself, and make inquiries. But
I am glad to find that his son is living, and that I yet
have it in my power to make restitution."</p>

<p>Fosdick could hardly believe his ears. Was he
after all to receive the money which he had supposed
irrevocably lost?</p>

<p>As for Dick it is not too much to say that he felt
even more pleased at the prospective good fortune of
his friend than if it had fallen to himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">FOSDICK'S FORTUNE.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bates</span></span> took from his pocket a memorandum
book, and jotted down a few figures in it.</p>

<p>"As nearly as I can remember," he said, "it is
four years since I ceased paying interest on the
money which your father entrusted to me. The rate
I agreed to pay was six per cent. How much will
that amount to?"</p>

<p>"Principal and interest two thousand four hundred
and eighty dollars," said Dick, promptly.</p>

<p>Fosdick's breath was almost taken away as he
heard this sum mentioned. Could it be possible that
Mr. Bates intended to pay him as much as this?
Why, it would be a fortune.</p>

<p>"Your figures would be quite correct, Mr. Hunter"
said Mr. Bates, "but for one consideration. You forget
that your friend is entitled to compound interest,
as no interest has been paid for four years. Now, as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>

you are do doubt used to figures, I will leave you to
make the necessary correction."</p>

<p>Mr. Bates tore a leaf from his memorandum book
as he spoke, and handed it with a pencil to Richard
Hunter.</p>

<p>Dick made a rapid calculation, and reported two
thousand five hundred and twenty-four dollars.</p>

<p>"It seems, then, Mr. Fosdick," said Mr. Bates,
"that I am your debtor to a very considerable
amount."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, sir," said Fosdick; "but I
shall be quite satisfied with the two thousand dollars
without any interest."</p>

<p>"Thank you for offering to relinquish the interest;
but it is only right that I should pay it. I have had
the use of the money, and I certainly would not wish
to defraud you of a penny of the sum which it took
your father ten years of industry to accumulate. I
wish he were living now to see justice done his son."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Fosdick, earnestly. "I beg your
pardon, sir," he said, after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Mr. Bates in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"Because," said Fosdick, "I have done you injustice.
I thought you failed in order to make money,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>

and intended to cheat my father out of his savings.
That made me feel hard towards you."</p>

<p>"You were justified in feeling so," said Mr. Bates.
"Such cases are so common that I am not surprised
at your opinion of me. I ought to have explained
my position to your father, and promised to make
restitution whenever it should be in my power. But
at the time I was discouraged, and could not foresee
the favorable turn which my affairs have since taken.
Now," he added, with a change of voice, "we will
arrange about the payment of this money."</p>

<p>"Do not pay it until it is convenient, Mr. Bates,"
said Fosdick.</p>

<p>"Your proposal is kind, but scarcely business-like,
Mr. Fosdick," said Mr. Bates. "Fortunately it will
occasion me no inconvenience to pay you at once I
have not the ready money with me as you may suppose,
but I will give you a cheque for the amount
upon the Broadway Bank, with which I have an account;
and it will be duly honored on presentation
to-morrow. You may in return make out a receipt
in full for the debt and interest. Wait a moment.
I will ring for writing materials."</p>

<p>These were soon brought by a servant of the hotel

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>

and Mr. Bates filled in a cheque for the sum specified
above, while Fosdick, scarcely knowing whether
he was awake or dreaming, made out a receipt to
which he attached his name.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Bates, "we will exchange
documents."</p>

<p>Fosdick took the cheque, and deposited it carefully
in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>"It is possible that payment might be refused to
a boy like you, especially as the amount is so large.
At what time will you be disengaged to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I am absent from the store from twelve to one
for dinner."</p>

<p>"Very well, come to the hotel as soon as you are
free, and I will accompany you to the bank, and get
the money for you. I advise you, however, to leave
it there on deposit until you have a chance to
invest it."</p>

<p>"How would you advise me to invest it, sir?"
asked Fosdick.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you cannot do better than buy shares
of some good bank. You will then have no care except
to collect your dividends twice a year."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is what I should like to do," said Fosdick.
"What bank would you advise?"</p>

<p>"The Broadway, Park, or Bank of Commerce,
are all good banks. I will attend to the matter for
you, if you desire it."</p>

<p>"I should be very glad if you would, sir."</p>

<p>"Then that matter is settled," said Mr. Bates.
"I wish I could as easily settle another matter
which has brought me to New York at this time,
and which, I confess, occasions me considerable
perplexity."</p>

<p>The boys remained respectfully silent, though not
without curiosity as to what this matter might
be.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates seemed plunged in thought for a short
time. Then speaking, as if to himself, he said, in a
low voice, "Why should I not tell them? Perhaps
they may help me."</p>

<p>"I believe," he said, "I will take you into my
confidence. You may be able to render me some
assistance in my perplexing business."</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to help you if I can," said
Dick.</p>

<p>"And I also," said Fosdick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have come to New York in search of my
grandson," said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>"Did he run away from home?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"No, he has never lived with me. Indeed, I may
add that I have never seen him since he was an
infant."</p>

<p>The boys looked surprised.</p>

<p>"How old is he now?" asked Fosdick.</p>

<p>"He must be about ten years old. But I see
that I must give you the whole story of what is a
painful passage in my life, or you will be in no
position to help me.</p>

<p>"You must know, then, that twelve years since I
considered myself rich, and lived in a handsome
house up town. My wife was dead, but I had an
only daughter, who I believe was generally considered
attractive, if not beautiful. I had set my heart
upon her making an advantageous marriage; that is,
marrying a man of wealth and social position. I had
in my employ a clerk, of excellent business abilities,
and of good personal appearance, whom I sometimes
invited to my house when I entertained company.
His name was John Talbot. I never suspected that
there was any danger of my daughter's falling in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>

love with the young man, until one day he came to
me and overwhelmed me with surprise by asking
her hand in marriage.</p>

<p>"You can imagine that I was very angry,
whether justly or not I will not pretend to say. I
dismissed the young man from my employ, and informed
him that never, under any circumstances,
would I consent to his marrying Irene. He was a
high-spirited young man, and, though he did not
answer me, I saw by the expression of his face that
he meant to persevere in his suit.</p>

<p>"A week later my daughter was missing. She
left behind a letter stating that she could not give
up John Talbot, and by the time I read the letter
she would be his wife. Two days later a Philadelphia
paper was sent me containing a printed notice of
their marriage, and the same mail brought me a
joint letter from both, asking my forgiveness.</p>

<p>"I had no objections to John Talbot except his
poverty; but my ambitious hopes were disappointed,
and I felt the blow severely. I returned the letter
to the address given, accompanied by a brief line to
Irene, to the effect that I disowned her, and would
never more acknowledge her as my daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw her only once after that. Two years after she appeared suddenly
in my library, having been admitted by the servant, with a child in
her arms. But I hardened my heart against her, and though she besought
my forgiveness, I refused it, and requested her to leave the house. I
cannot forgive myself when I think of my unfeeling severity. But it is
too late too redeem the past. As far as I can I would like to atone for
it.</p>

<p>"A month since I heard that both Irene and her
husband were dead, the latter five years since, but
that the child, a boy, is still living, probably in deep
poverty. He is my only descendant, and I seek to
find him, hoping that he may be a joy and solace to
me in the old age which will soon be upon me. It
is for the purpose of tracing him that I have come to
New York. When you," turning to Fosdick, "referred
to your being compelled to resort to the streets, and
the hard life of a boot-black, the thought came to me
that my grandson may be reduced to a similar extremity.
It would be hard indeed that he should
grow up ignorant, neglected, and subject to every
privation, when a comfortable and even luxurious
home awaits him, if he can only be found."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is his name?" inquired Dick.</p>

<p>"My impression is, that he was named after his
father, John Talbot. Indeed, I am quite sure that
my daughter wrote me to this effect in a letter which
I returned after reading."</p>

<p>"Have you reason to think he is in New York?"</p>

<p>"My information is, that his mother died here a
year since. It is not likely that he has been able to
leave the city."</p>

<p>"He is about ten years old?"</p>

<p>"I used to know most of the boot-blacks and newsboys
when I was in the business," said Dick, reflectively;
"but I cannot recall that name."</p>

<p>"Were you ever in the business, Mr. Hunter?"
asked Mr. Bates, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Richard Hunter, smiling; "I used
to be one of the most ragged boot-blacks in the city.
Don't you remember my Washington coat, and Napoleon
pants, Fosdick?"</p>

<p>"I remember them well."</p>

<p>"Surely that was many years ago?"</p>

<p>"It is not yet two years since I gave up blacking
boots."</p>

<p>"You surprise me Mr. Hunter," said Mr. Bates

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>

"I congratulate you on your advance in life. Such
a rise shows remarkable energy on your part."</p>

<p>"I was lucky," said Dick, modestly. "I found
some good friends who helped me along. But about
your grandson: I have quite a number of friends
among the street-boys, and I can inquire of them
whether any boy named John Talbot has joined their
ranks since my time."</p>

<p>"I shall be greatly obliged to you if you will,"
said Mr. Bates. "But it is quite possible that circumstances
may have led to a change of name, so
that it will not do to trust too much to this. Even
if no boy bearing that name is found, I shall feel
that there is this possibility in my favor."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Dick. "It is very common
for boys to change their name. Some can't remember
whether they ever had any names, and pick
one out to suit themselves, or perhaps get one from
those they go with. There was one boy I knew
named 'Horace Greeley'. Then there were 'Fat
Jack,' 'Pickle Nose,' 'Cranky Jim,' 'Tickle-me-foot,'
and plenty of others.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> You knew some of
them, didn't you, Fosdick?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew 'Fat Jack' and 'Tickle-me-Foot,'" answered
Fosdick.</p>

<p>"This of course increases the difficulty of finding
and identifying the boy," said Mr. Bates.
"Here," he said, taking a card photograph from his
pocket, "is a picture of my daughter at the time
of her marriage. I have had these taken from a
portrait in my possession."</p>

<p>"Can you spare me one?" asked Dick. "It
may help me to find the boy."</p>

<p>"I will give one to each of you. I need not say
that I shall feel most grateful for any service you
may be able to render me, and will gladly reimburse
any expenses you may incur, besides paying you
liberally for your time. It will be better perhaps
for me to leave fifty dollars with each of you to defray
any expenses you may be at."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Dick; "but I am well supplied
with money, and will advance whatever is needful,
and if I succeed I will hand in my bill."</p>

<p>Fosdick expressed himself in a similar way,
and after some further conversation he and Dick
rose to go.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you on your wealth, Fosdick,"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>

said Dick, when they were outside. "You're richer
than I am now."</p>

<p>"I never should have got this money but for you,
Dick. I wish you'd take some of it."</p>

<p>"Well, I will. You may pay my fare home on
the horse-cars."</p>

<p>"But really I wish you would."</p>

<p>But this Dick positively refused to do, as might
have been expected. He was himself the owner of
two up-town lots, which he eventually sold for five
thousand dollars, though they only cost him one,
and had three hundred dollars besides in the bank.
He agreed, however, to let Fosdick henceforth bear
his share of the expenses of board, and this added
two dollars a week to the sum he was able to lay
up.</p>

to his appointment at the Astor House on the
following day.</p>

<p>He found Mr. Bates in the reading-room, looking
over a Milwaukie paper.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Fosdick," he said, extending
his hand. "I suppose your time is limited,
therefore it will be best for us to go at once to the
bank."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, sir, to take so much trouble
on my account," said Fosdick.</p>

<p>"We ought all to help each other," said Mr.
Bates. "I believe in that doctrine, though I have
not always lived up to it. On second thoughts,"
he added, as they got out in front of the hotel, "if
you approve of my suggestions about the purchase
of bank shares, it may not be necessary to go

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>

to the bank, as you can take this cheque in payment."</p>

<p>"Just as you think best, sir. I can depend upon
your judgment, as you know much more of such
things than I."</p>

<p>"Then we will go at once to the office of Mr.
Ferguson, a Wall Street broker, and an old friend
of mine. There we will give an order for some
bank shares."</p>

<p>Together the two walked down Broadway until
they reached Trinity Church, which fronts the
entrance to Wall Street. Here then they crossed
the street, and soon reached the office of Mr. Ferguson.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson, a pleasant-looking man with sandy
hair and whiskers, came forward and shook Mr. Bates
cordially by the hand.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, Mr. Bates," he said. "Where
have you been for the last four years?"</p>

<p>"In Milwaukie. I see you are at the old
place."</p>

<p>"Yes, plodding along as usual. How do you
like the West?"</p>

<p>"I have found it a good place for business, though

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>

I am not sure whether I like it as well to live in as
New York."</p>

<p>"Shan't you come back to New York some
time?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bates shook his head.</p>

<p>"My business ties me to Milwaukie," he said.
"I doubt if I ever return."</p>

<p>"Who is this young man?" said the broker,
looking at Fosdick. "He is not a son of yours I
think?"</p>

<p>"No; I am not fortunate enough to have a son.
He is a young friend who wants a little business
done in your line and, I have accordingly brought
him to you."</p>

<p>"We will do our best for him. What is it?"</p>

<p>"He wants to purchase twenty shares in some
good city bank. I used to know all about such matters
when I lived in the city, but I am out of the
way of such knowledge now."</p>

<p>"Twenty shares, you said?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It happens quite oddly that a party brought in
only fifteen minutes since twenty shares in the &mdash;&mdash;
Bank to dispose of. It is a good bank, and I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>

don't know that he can do any better than take
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a good bank. What interest does it
pay now?"</p>

<p>"Eight per cent."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"That is good. What is the market value of the
stock?"</p>

<p>"It is selling this morning at one hundred and
twenty."</p>

<p>"Twenty shares then will amount to twenty-four
hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps we had better take them. What
do you say, Mr. Fosdick?"</p>

<p>"If you advise it, sir, I shall be very glad to
do so."</p>

<p>"Then the business can be accomplished at once,
as the party left us his signature, authorizing the
transfer."</p>

<p>The transfer was rapidly effected. The broker's
commission of twenty-five cents per share amounted
to five dollars. It was found on paying this, added
to the purchase money, that one hundred and nineteen</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>dollars remained,&mdash;the cheque being for two
thousand five hundred and twenty-four dollars.</p>

<p>The broker took the cheque, and returned this
sum, which Mr. Bates handed to Fosdick.</p>

<p>"You may need this for a reserve fund," he said,
"to draw upon if needful until your dividend comes
due. The bank shares will pay you probably one
hundred and sixty dollars per year."</p>

<p>"One hundred and sixty dollars!" repeated Fosdick,
in surprise. "That is a little more than three
dollars a week."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It will be very acceptable, as my salary at the
store is not enough to pay my expenses."</p>

<p>"I would advise you not to break in upon your
capital if you can avoid it," said Mr. Bates. "By
and by, if your salary increases, you may be able to
add the interest yearly to the principal, so that
it may be accumulating till you are a man, when
you may find it of use in setting you up in business."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I will remember that. But I can
hardly realize that I am really the owner of twenty
bank shares."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"No doubt it seems sudden to you. Don't let
it make you extravagant. Most boys of your age
would need a guardian, but you have had so much
experience in taking care of yourself, that I think
you can get along without one."</p>

<p>"I have my friend Dick to advise me," said Fosdick.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunter seems quite a remarkable young
man," said Mr. Bates. "I can hardly believe that
his past history has been as he gave it."</p>

<p>"It is strictly true, sir. Three years ago he
could not read or write."</p>

<p>"If he continues to display the same energy, I
can predict for him a prominent position in the
future."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say so, sir. Dick is a
very dear friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Fosdick, it is time you were thinking
of dinner. I believe this is your dinner hour?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And it is nearly over. You must be my guest
to-day. I know of a quiet little lunch room near
by, which I used to frequent some years ago when I
was in business on this street. We will drop in there

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>

and I think you will be able to get through in
time."</p>

<p>Fosdick could not well decline the invitation, but
accompanied Mr. Bates to the place referred to,
where he had a better meal than he was accustomed
to. It was finished in time, for as the clock on
the city hall struck one, he reached the door of
Henderson's store.</p>

<p>Fosdick could not very well banish from his mind
the thoughts of his extraordinary change of fortune,
and I am obliged to confess that he did not discharge
his duties quite as faithfully as usual that afternoon.
I will mention one rather amusing instance of his
preoccupation of mind.</p>

<p>A lady entered the store, leading by the hand her
son Edwin, a little boy of seven.</p>

<p>"Have you any hats that will fit my little boy?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Fosdick, absently, and
brought forward a large-sized man's hat, of the kind
popularly known as "stove-pipe."</p>

<p>"How will this do?" asked Fosdick.</p>

<p>"I don't want to wear such an ugly hat as that,"
said Edwin, in dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The lady looked at Fosdick as if she had very
strong doubts of his sanity. He saw his mistake,
and, coloring deeply, said, in a hurried tone, "Excuse
me; I was thinking of something else."</p>

<p>The next selection proved more satisfactory, and
Edwin went out of the store feeling quite proud of
his new hat.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the afternoon, Fosdick was
surprised at the entrance of Mr. Bates. He came
up to the counter where he was standing, and said,
"I am glad I have found you in. I was not quite
sure if this was the place where you were employed."</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, sir," said Fosdick.</p>

<p>"I have just received a telegram from Milwaukie,"
said Mr. Bates, "summoning me home immediately
on matters connected with business. I shall
not therefore be able to remain here to follow up the
search upon which I had entered. As you and your
friend have kindly offered your assistance, I am
going to leave the matter in your hands, and will
authorize you to incur any expenses you may deem
advisable, and I will gladly reimburse you whether
you succeed or not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Fosdick assured him that they would spare no
efforts, and Mr. Bates, after briefly thanking him,
and giving him his address, hurried away, as he had
determined to start on his return home that very
night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">INTRODUCES MARK, THE MATCH BOY.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">It</span></span> was growing dark, though yet scarcely six o'clock,
for the day was one of the shortest in the year, when
a small boy, thinly clad, turned down Frankfort
Street on the corner opposite French's Hotel. He
had come up Nassau Street, passing the "Tribune"
Office and the old Tammany Hall, now superseded
by the substantial new "Sun" building.</p>

<p>He had a box of matches under his arm, of which
very few seemed to have been sold. He had a weary,
spiritless air, and walked as if quite tired. He had
been on his feet all day, and was faint with hunger,
having eaten nothing but an apple to sustain his
strength. The thought that he was near his journey's
end did not seem to cheer him much. Why
this should be so will speedily appear.</p>

<p>He crossed William Street, passed Gold Street,
and turned down Vandewater Street, leading out of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>

Frankfort's Street on the left. It is in the form of a
short curve, connecting with that most crooked of all
New York avenues, Pearl Street. He paused in
front of a shabby house, and went upstairs. The
door of a room on the third floor was standing ajar.
He pushed it open, and entered, not without a kind
of shrinking.</p>

<p>A coarse-looking woman was seated before a scanty
fire. She had just thrust a bottle into her pocket
after taking a copious draught therefrom, and her
flushed face showed that this had long been a habit
with her.</p>

<p>"Well, Mark, what luck to-night?" she said, in a
husky voice.</p>

<p>"I didn't sell much," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Didn't sell much? Come here," said the woman,
sharply.</p>

<p>Mark came up to her side, and she snatched the
box from him, angrily.</p>

<p>"Only three boxes gone?" she repeated. "What
have you been doing all day?"</p>

<p>She added to the question a coarse epithet which
I shall not repeat.</p>

<p>"I tried to sell them, indeed I did, Mother Watson,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>

indeed I did," said the boy, earnestly, "but everybody
had bought them already."</p>

<p>"You didn't try," said the woman addressed as
Mother Watson. "You're too lazy, that's what's
the matter. You don't earn your salt. Now give
me the money."</p>

<p>Mark drew from his pocket a few pennies, and
handed to her.</p>

<p>She counted them over, and then, looking up
sharply, said, with a frown,"There's a penny short.
Where is it?"</p>

<p>"I was so hungry," pleaded Mark, "that I bought
an apple,&mdash;only a little one."</p>

<p>"You bought an apple, did you?" said the woman,
menacingly. "So that's the way you spend
my money, you little thief?"</p>

<p>"I was so faint and hungry," again pleaded the
boy.</p>

<p>"What business had you to be hungry? Didn't
you have some breakfast this morning?"</p>

<p>"I had a piece of bread."</p>

<p>"That's more than you earned. You'll eat me
out of house and home, you little thief! But I'll
pay you off. I'll give you something to take away

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>

your appetite. You won't be hungry any more, I
reckon."</p>

<p>She dove her flabby hand into her pocket, and
produced a strap, at which the boy gazed with frightened
look.</p>

<p>"Don't beat me, Mother Watson," he said, imploringly.</p>

<p>"I'll beat the laziness out of you," said the woman,
vindictively. "See if I don't."</p>

<p>She clutched Mark by the collar, and was about
to bring the strap down forcibly upon his back, ill
protected by his thin jacket, when a visitor entered
the room.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mrs. Watson?" asked the
intruder.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, Mrs. Flanagan?" said the woman,
holding the strap suspended in the air. "I'll tell you
what's the matter. This little thief has come home,
after selling only three boxes of matches the whole
day, and I find he's stole a penny to buy an apple
with. It's for that I'm goin' to beat him."</p>

<p>"Oh, let him alone, the poor lad," said Mrs. Flanagan,
who was a warm-hearted Irish woman. "Maybe
he was hungry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why didn't he work? Them that work can
eat."</p>

<p>"Maybe people didn't want to buy."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't afford to keep him in his idleness,"
said Mrs. Watson. "He may go to bed without his
supper."</p>

<p>"If he can't sell his matches, maybe people would
give him something."</p>

<p>Mrs. Watson evidently thought favorably of this
suggestion, for, turning to Mark, she said, "Go
out again, you little thief, and mind you don't come
in again till you've got twenty-five cents to bring to
me. Do you mind that?"</p>

<p>Mark listened, but stood irresolute:</p>

<p>"I don't like to beg," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't like to beg!" screamed Mrs. Watson.
"Do you mind that, now, Mrs. Flanagan? He's
too proud to beg."</p>

<p>"Mother told me never to beg if I could help it,"
said Mark.</p>

<p>"Well, you can't help it," said the woman, flourishing
the strap in a threatening manner. "Do you
see this?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you'll feel it too, if you don't do as I tell
you. Go out now."</p>

<p>"I'm so hungry," said Mark; "won't you give
me a piece of bread?"</p>

<p>"Not a mouthful till you bring back twenty-five
cents. Start now, or you'll feel the strap."</p>

<p>The boy left the room with a slow step, and
wearily descended the stairs. I hope my young
readers will never know the hungry craving after
food which tormented the poor little boy as he
made his way towards the street. But he had hardly
reached the foot of the first staircase when he heard
a low voice behind him, and, turning, beheld Mrs.
Flanagan, who had hastily followed after him.</p>

<p>"Are you very hungry?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm faint with hunger."</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" she said, compassionately; "come
in here a minute."</p>

<p>She opened the door of her own room which was
just at the foot of the staircase, and gently pushed
him in.</p>

<p>It was a room of the same general appearance as
the one above, but was much neater looking.</p>

<p>"Biddy Flanagan isn't the woman to let a poor

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>

motherless child go hungry when she's a bit of bread
or meat by her. Here, Mark, lad, sit down, and I'll
soon bring you something that'll warm up your poor
stomach."</p>

<p>She opened a cupboard, and brought out a plate
containing a small quantity of cold beef, and two
slices of bread.</p>

<p>"There's some better mate than you'll get of
Mother Watson. It's cold, but it's good."</p>

<p>"She never gives me any meat at all," said Mark,
gazing with a look of eager anticipation at the plate
which to his famished eye looked so inviting.</p>

<p>"I'll be bound she don't," said Mrs. Flanagan.
"Talk of you being lazy! What does she do herself
but sit all day doing nothin' except drink whiskey
from the black bottle! She might get washin'
to do, as I do, if she wanted to, but she won't work.
She expects you to get money enough for both of
you."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Flanagan had poured out a cup
of tea from an old tin teapot that stood on the stove.</p>

<p>"There, drink that, Mark dear," she said. "It'll
warm you up, and you'll need it this cold night, I'm
thinkin'."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The tea was not of the best quality, and the cup
was cracked and discolored; but to Mark it was grateful
and refreshing, and he eagerly drank it.</p>

<p>"Is it good?" asked the sympathizing woman,
observing with satisfaction the eagerness with which
it was drunk.</p>

<p>"Yes, it makes me feel warm," said Mark.</p>

<p>"It's better nor the whiskey Mother Watson
drinks," said Mrs. Flanagan. "It won't make your
nose red like hers. It would be a sight better for
her if she'd throw away the whiskey, and take to the
tea."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Mrs. Flanagan," said Mark,
rising from the table, feeling fifty per cent. better
than when he sat down.</p>

<p>"Oh bother now, don't say a word about it! Shure
you're welcome to the bit you've eaten, and the little
sup of tea. Come in again when you feel hungry
and Bridget Flanagan won't be the woman to send
you off hungry if she's got anything in the cupboard."</p>

<p>"I wish Mother Watson was as good as you are,"
said Mark.</p>

<p>"I aint so good as I might be," said Mrs. Flanagan;
"but I wouldn't be guilty of tratin' a poor

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>

boy as that woman trates you, more shame to her!
How came you with her any way? She aint your
mother, is she."</p>

<p>"No," said Mark, shuddering at the bare idea.
"My mother was a good woman, and worked hard.
She didn't drink whiskey. Mother was always kind
to me. I wish she was alive now."</p>

<p>"When did she die, Mark dear?"</p>

<p>"It's going on a year since she died. I didn't
know what to do, but Mother Watson told me to
come and live with her, and she'd take care of me."</p>

<p>"Sorra a bit of kindness there was in that," commented
Mrs. Flanagan. "She wanted you to take
care of her. Well, and what did she make you do?"</p>

<p>"She sent me out to earn what I could. Sometimes
I would run on errands, but lately I have sold
matches."</p>

<p>"Is it hard work sellin' them?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I do pretty well, but some days it
seems as if nobody wanted any. To-day I went
round to a great many offices, but they all had as
many as they wanted, and I didn't sell but three
boxes. I tried to sell more, indeed I did, but I
couldn't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"No doubt you did, Mark, dear. It's cold you
must be in that thin jacket of yours this cold weather.
I've got a shawl you may wear if you like. You'll
not lose it, I know."</p>

<p>But Mark had a boy's natural dislike to being dressed as a girl,
knowing, moreover, that his appearance in the street with Mrs.
Flanagan's shawl would subject him to the jeers of the street boys. So
he declined the offer with thanks, and, buttoning up his thin jacket,
descended the remaining staircase, and went out again into the chilling
and uninviting street. A chilly, drizzling rain had just set in, and
this made it even more dreary than it had been during the day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">BEN GIBSON.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">But</span></span> it was not so much the storm or the cold
weather that Mark cared for. He had become used
to these, so far as one can become used to what is
very disagreeable. If after a hard day's work he
had had a good home to come back to, or a kind and
sympathizing friend, he would have had that thought
to cheer him up. But Mother Watson cared nothing
for him, except for the money he brought her, and
Mark found it impossible either to cherish love or
respect for the coarse woman whom he generally
found more or less affected by whiskey.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p060.jpg" alt=""  />
<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Dick as a Philanthropist.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Cold and hungry as he had been oftentimes, he had
always shrunk from begging. It seemed to lower
him in his own thoughts to ask charity of others.
Mother Watson had suggested it to him once or twice,
but had never actually commanded it before. Now
he was required to bring home twenty-five cents. He

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>

knew very well what would be the result if he failed
to do this. Mother Watson would apply the leather
strap with merciless fury, and he knew that his
strength was as nothing compared to hers. So, for
the first time in his life, he felt that he must make
up his mind to beg.</p>

<p>He retraced his steps to the head of Frankfort
Street, and walked slowly down Nassau Street. The
rain was falling, as I have said, and those who could
remained under shelter. Besides, business hours
were over. The thousands who during the day
made the lower part of the city a busy hive had gone
to their homes in the upper portion of the island, or
across the river to Brooklyn or the towns on the
Jersey shore. So, however willing he might be to
beg, there did not seem to be much chance at present.</p>

<p>The rain increased, and Mark in his thin clothes
was soon drenched to the skin. He felt damp, cold,
and uncomfortable. But there was no rest for him.
The only home he had was shut to him, unless he
should bring home twenty-five cents, and of this there
seemed very little prospect.</p>

<p>At the corner of Fulton Street he fell in with a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>

boy of twelve, short and sturdy in frame, dressed in
a coat whose tails nearly reached the sidewalk.
Though scarcely in the fashion, it was warmer than
Mark's, and the proprietor troubled himself very little
about the looks.</p>

<p>This boy, whom Mark recognized as Ben Gibson,
had a clay pipe in his mouth, which he seemed to be
smoking with evident enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Where you goin'?" he asked, halting in front
of Mark.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Don't know!" repeated Ben, taking his pipe
from his mouth, and spitting. "Where's your
matches?"</p>

<p>"I left them at home."</p>

<p>"Then what'd did you come out for in this
storm?"</p>

<p>"The woman I live with won't let me come home
till I've brought her twenty-five cents."</p>

<p>"How'd you expect to get it?"</p>

<p>"She wants me to beg."</p>

<p>"That's a good way," said Ben, approvingly;
"when you get hold of a soft chap, or a lady,
them's the ones to shell out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't like it," said Mark. "I don't want
people to think me a beggar."</p>

<p>"What's the odds?" said Ben, philosophically.
"You're just the chap to make a good beggar."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, Ben?" said Mark,
who was far from considering this much of a compliment.</p>

<p>"Why you're a thin, pale little chap, that people
will pity easy. Now I aint the right cut for a beggar.
I tried it once, but it was no go."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Mark, who began to be interested
in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"You see," said Ben, again puffing out a volume
of smoke, "I look too tough, as if I could take care
of myself. People don't pity me. I tried it one
night when I was hard up. I hadn't got but six
cents, and I wanted to go to the Old Bowery bad.
So I went up to a gent as was comin' up Wall Street
from the Ferry, and said, 'Won't you give a poor
boy a few pennies to save him from starvin'?'"</p>

<p>"'So you're almost starvin', are you, my lad?'"
says he.</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' says I, as faint as I could.</p>

<p>"'Well, starvin' seems to agree with you,' says

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>

he, laughin'. 'You're the healthiest-lookin' beggar
I've seen in a good while.'</p>

<p>"I tried it again on another gent, and he told me
he guessed I was lazy; that a good stout boy like me
ought to work. So I didn't make much beggin', and
had to give up goin' to the Old Bowery that night,
which I was precious sorry for, for there was a great
benefit that evenin'. Been there often?"</p>

<p>"No, I never went."</p>

<p>"Never went to the Old Bowery!" ejaculated
Ben, whistling in his amazement. "Where were
you raised, I'd like to know? I should think you
was a country greeny, I should."</p>

<p>"I never had a chance," said Mark, who began
to feel a little ashamed of the confession.</p>

<p>"Won't your old woman let you go?"</p>

<p>"I never have any money to go."</p>

<p>"If I was flush I'd take you myself. It's only
fifteen cents," said Ben. "But I haven't got money
enough only for one ticket. I'm goin' to-night."</p>

<p>"Are you?" asked Mark, a little enviously.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a good way to pass a rainy evenin'.
You've got a warm room to be in, let alone the play,
which is splendid. Now, if you could only beg fifteen

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>

cents from some charitable cove, you might go
along of me."</p>

<p>"If I get any money I've got to carry it home."</p>

<p>"Suppose you don't, will the old woman cut up
rough?"</p>

<p>"She'll beat me with a strap," said Mark, shuddering.</p>

<p>"What makes you let her do it?" demanded Ben,
rather disdainfully.</p>

<p>"I can't help it."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't beat me," said Ben, decidedly.</p>

<p>"What would you do?" asked Mark, with interest.</p>

<p>"What would I do?" retorted Ben. "I'd kick,
and bite, and give her one for herself between the
eyes. That's what I'd do. She'd find me a hard
case, I reckon."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be any use for me to try that," said
Mark. "She's too strong."</p>

<p>"It don't take much to handle you," said Ben,
taking a critical survey of the physical points of
Mark. "You're most light enough to blow away."</p>

<p>"I'm only ten years old," said Mark, apologetically.
"I shall be bigger some time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe," said Ben, dubiously; "but you don't
look as if you'd ever be tough like me."</p>

<p>"There," he added, after a pause, "I've smoked
all my 'baccy. I wish I'd got some more."</p>

<p>"Do you like to smoke?" asked Mark.</p>

<p>"It warms a feller up," said Ben. "It's jest the
thing for a cold, wet day like this. Didn't you ever
try it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"If I'd got some 'baccy here, I'd give you a
whiff; but I think it would make you sick the first
time."</p>

<p>"I don't think I should like it," said Mark, who
had never felt any desire to smoke, though he knew
plenty of boys who indulged in the habit.</p>

<p>"That's because you don't know nothin' about
it," remarked Ben. "I didn't like it at first till I
got learned."</p>

<p>"Do you smoke often?"</p>

<p>"Every day after I get through blackin' boots;
that is, when I aint hard up, and can't raise the
stamps to pay for the 'baccy. But I guess I'll be
goin' up to the Old Bowery. It's most time for the
doors to open. Where you goin'?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know where to go," said Mark, helplessly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you where you'd better go. You won'
find nobody round here. Besides it aint comfortable
lettin' the rain fall on you and wet you through."
(While this conversation was going on, the boys had
sheltered themselves in a doorway.) "Just you go
down to Fulton Market. There you'll be out of the
wet, and you'll see plenty of people passin' through
when the boats come in. Maybe some of 'em will
give you somethin'. Then ag'in, there's the boats.
Some nights I sleep aboard the boats."</p>

<p>"You do? Will they let you?"</p>

<p>"They don't notice. I just pay my two cents,
and go aboard, and snuggle up in a corner and go to
sleep. So I ride to Brooklyn and back all night.
That's cheaper'n the Newsboys' Lodgin' House, for
it only costs two cents. One night a gentleman
came to me, and woke me up, and said, 'We've got
to Brooklyn, my lad. If you don't get up they'll
carry you back again.'</p>

<p>"I jumped up and told him I was much obliged,
as I didn't know what my family would say if I
didn't get home by eleven o'clock. Then, just as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>

soon as his back was turned, I sat down again and
went to sleep. It aint so bad sleepin' aboard the
boat, 'specially in a cold night. They keep the
cabin warm, and though the seat isn't partic'larly
soft its better'n bein' out in the street. If you don't
get your twenty-five cents, and are afraid of a lickin',
you'd better sleep aboard the boat."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will," said Mark, to whom the idea
was not unwelcome, for it would at all events save
him for that night from the beating which would be
his portion if he came home without the required
sum.</p>

<p>"Well, good-night," said Ben; "I'll be goin'
along."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Ben," said Mark, "I guess I'll go
to Fulton Market."</p>

<p>Accordingly Mark turned down Fulton Street,
while Ben steered in the direction of Chatham Street,
through which it was necessary to pass in order to
reach the theatre, which is situated on the Bowery,
not far from its junction with Chatham Street.</p>

<p>Ben Gibson is a type of a numerous class of improvident
boys, who live on from day to day, careless
of appearances, spending their evenings where they

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>

can, at the theatre when their means admit, and
sometimes at gambling saloons. Not naturally bad,
they drift into bad habits from the force of outward
circumstances. They early learn to smoke or chew,
finding in tobacco some comfort during the cold and
wet days, either ignorant of or indifferent to the
harm which the insidious weed will do to their constitutions.
So their growth is checked, or their
blood is impoverished, as is shown by their pale
faces.</p>

<p>As for Ben, he was gifted with a sturdy frame and
an excellent constitution, and appeared as yet to exhibit
none of the baneful effects of this habit. But
no growing boy can smoke without ultimately being
affected by it, and such will no doubt be the case
with Ben.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII. </h2>
</div>

<p class="center">FULTON MARKET.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">Just</span></span>
across from Fulton Ferry stands Fulton
Market. It is nearly fifty years old, having been
built in 1821, on ground formerly occupied by unsightly
wooden buildings, which were, perhaps fortunately,
swept away by fire. It covers the block
bounded by Fulton, South, Beekman, and Front
Streets, and was erected at a cost of about quarter of
a million of dollars.</p>

<p>This is the chief of the great city markets, and an
immense business is done here. There is hardly an
hour in the twenty-four in which there is an entire
lull in the business of the place. Some of the outside
shops and booths are kept open all night, while
the supplies of fish, meats, and vegetables for the
market proper are brought at a very early hour,
almost before it can be called morning.</p>

<p>Besides the market proper the surrounding sidewalks

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>

are roofed over, and lined with shops and booths
of the most diverse character, at which almost every
conceivable article can be purchased. Most numerous,
perhaps, are the chief restaurants, the counters
loaded with cakes and pies, with a steaming vessel of
coffee smoking at one end. The floors are sanded,
and the accommodations are far from elegant or luxurious;
but it is said that the viands are by no means
to be despised. Then there are fruit-stalls with tempting
heaps of oranges, apples, and in their season the
fruits of summer, presided over for the most part by
old women, who scan shrewdly the faces of passers-by,
and are ready on the smallest provocation to vaunt
the merits of their wares. There are candy and cocoanut
cakes for those who have a sweet tooth, and
many a shop-boy invests in these on his way to or
from Brooklyn to the New York store where he is
employed; or the father of a family, on his way to his
Brooklyn home, thinks of the little ones awaiting him,
and indulges in a purchase of what he knows will be
sure to be acceptable to them.</p>

<p>But it is not only the wants of the body that are
provided for at Fulton Market. On the Fulton
Street side may be found extensive booths, at which

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>

are displayed for sale a tempting array of papers, magazines,
and books, as well as stationery, photograph
albums, etc., generally at prices twenty or thirty
per cent. lower than is demanded for them in the
more pretentious Broadway or Fulton Avenue stores.</p>

<p>Even at night, therefore, the outer portion of the
market presents a bright and cheerful shelter from
the inclement weather, being securely roofed over,
and well lighted, while some of the booths are kept
open, however late the hour.</p>

<p>Ben Gibson, therefore, was right in directing Mark
to Fulton Market, as probably the most comfortable
place to be found in the pouring rain which made the
thoroughfares dismal and dreary. Mark, of course,
had been in Fulton Market often, and saw at once
the wisdom of the advice. He ran down Fulton
Street as fast as he could, and arrived there panting
and wet to the skin. Uncomfortable as he was, the
change from the wet streets to the bright and comparatively
warm shelter of the market made him at
once more cheerful. In fact, it compared favorably
with the cold and uninviting room which he shared
with Mother Watson.</p>

<p>As Mark looked around him, he could not help

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>

wishing that he tended in one of the little restaurants
that looked so bright and inviting to him. Those
who are accustomed to lunch at Delmonico's, or at
some of the large and stylish hotels, or have their
meals served by attentive servants in brown stone
dwellings in the more fashionable quarters of the city,
would be likely to turn up their noses at his humble
taste, and would feel it an infliction to take a meal
amid such plebeian surroundings. But then Mark
knew nothing about the fare at Delmonico's, and was
far enough from living in a brown stone front, and
so his ideas of happiness and luxury were not very
exalted, or he would scarcely have envied a stout
butcher boy whom he saw sitting at an unpainted
wooden table, partaking of a repast which was more
abundant than choice.</p>

<p>But from the surrounding comfort Mark's thoughts
were brought back to the disagreeable business which
brought him here. He was to solicit charity from
some one of the passers-by, and with a sigh he began
to look about him to select some compassionate face.</p>

<p>"If there was only somebody here that wanted an
errand done," he thought, "and would pay me
twenty-five cents for doing it, I wouldn't have to beg

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>

I'd rather work two hours for the money than beg
it."</p>

<p>But there seemed little chance of this. In the
busy portion of the day there might have been some
chance, though this would be uncertain; but now it
was very improbable. If he wanted to get twenty-five
cents that night he must get it from charity.</p>

<p>A beginning must be made, however disagreeable.
So Mark went up to a young man who was passing
along on his way to the boat, and in a shamefaced
manner said, "Will you give me a few pennies,
please?"</p>

<p>The young man looked good-natured, and it was
that which gave Mark confidence to address him.</p>

<p>"You want some pennies, do you?" he said, with
a smile, pausing in his walk.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir."</p>

<p>"I suppose your wife and family are starving,
eh?"</p>

<p>"I haven't got any wife or family, sir," said Mark.</p>

<p>"But you've got a sick mother, or some brothers
or sisters that are starving, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I'm afraid you're not up to your business.
How long have you been round begging?"</p>

<p>"Never before," said Mark, rather indignantly.</p>

<p>"Ah, that accounts for it. You haven't learned
the business yet. After a few weeks you'll have a
sick mother starving at home. They all do, you
know."</p>

<p>"My mother is dead," said Mark; "I shan't tell
a lie to get money."</p>

<p>"Come, you're rather a remarkable boy," said
the young man, who was a reporter on a daily paper,
going over to attend a meeting in Brooklyn, to write
an account of it to appear in one of the city dailies in
the morning. "I don't generally give money in
such cases, but I must make an exception in your
case."</p>

<p>He drew a dime from his vest-pocket and handed
it to Mark.</p>

<p>Mark took it with a blush of mortification at the
necessity.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't beg if I could help it," he said, desiring
to justify himself in the eyes of the good-natured
young man.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear that. Johnny." (Johnny is a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>

common name applied to boys whose names are unknown.)
"It isn't a very creditable business. What
makes you beg, then?"</p>

<p>"I shall be beaten if I don't," said Mark.</p>

<p>"That's bad. Who will beat you?"</p>

<p>"Mother Watson."</p>

<p>"Tell Mother Watson, with my compliments, that
she's a wicked old tyrant. I'll tell you what, my lad,
you must grow as fast as you can, and by and by
you'll get too large for that motherly old woman to
whip. But there goes the bell. I must be getting
aboard."</p>

<p>This was the result of Mark's first begging appeal.
He looked at the money, and wished he had got it in
any other way. If it had been the reward of an
hour's work he would have gazed at it with much
greater satisfaction.</p>

<p>Well, he had made a beginning. He had got ten
cents. But there still remained fifteen cents to obtain,
and without that he did not feel safe in going
back.</p>

<p>So he looked about him for another person to
address. This time he thought he would ask a
lady. Accordingly he went up to one, who was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>

walking with her son, a boy of sixteen, to judge
from appearance, and asked for a few pennies.</p>

<p>"Get out of my way, you little beggar!" she
said, in a disagreeable tone. "Ain't you ashamed
of yourself, going round begging, instead of earning
money like honest people?"</p>

<p>"I've been trying to earn money all day," said
Mark, rather indignant at this attack.</p>

<p>"Oh no doubt," sneered the woman. "I don't
think you'll hurt yourself with work."</p>

<p>"I was round the streets all day trying to sell
matches," said Mark.</p>

<p>"You mustn't believe what he says, mother," said
the boy. "They're all a set of humbugs, and will
lie as fast as they can talk."</p>

<p>"I've no doubt of it, Roswell," said Mrs. Crawford.
"Such little impostors never get anything
out of me. I've got other uses for my money."</p>

<p>Mark was a gentle, peaceful boy, but such attacks
naturally made him indignant.</p>

<p>"I am not an impostor, and I neither lie nor
steal," he said, looking alternately from the mother
to the son.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're a fine young man. I've no doubt,"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>

said Roswell, with a sneer. "But we'd better be
getting on, mother, unless you mean to stop in Fulton
Market all night."</p>

<p>So mother and son passed on, leaving Mark with
a sense of mortification and injury. He would have
given the ten cents he had, not to have asked charity
of this woman who had answered him so unpleasantly.</p>

<p>Those of my readers who have read the two preceding
volumes of this series will recognize in Roswell
Crawford and his mother old acquaintances who played
an important part in the former stories. As, however,
I may have some new readers, it may be as
well to explain that Roswell was a self-conceited
boy, who prided himself on being "the son of a
gentleman," and whose great desire was to find a
place where the pay would be large and the duties
very small. Unfortunately for his pride, his father
had failed in business shortly before he died, and his
mother had been compelled to keep a boarding-house.
She, too, was troubled with a pride very similar to
that of her son, and chafed inwardly at her position,
instead of reconciling herself to it, as many better
persons have done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Roswell was not very fortunate in retaining the
positions he obtained, being generally averse to doing
anything except what he was absolutely obliged to
do. He had lost a situation in a dry-goods store in
Sixth Avenue, because he objected to carrying bundles,
considering it beneath the dignity of a gentleman's
son. Some months before he had tried to get
Richard Hunter discharged from his situation in the
hope of succeeding him in it; but this plot proved
utterly unsuccessful, as is fully described in "Fame
and Fortune."</p>

<p>We shall have more to do with Roswell Crawford
in the course of the present story. At present he
was employed in a retail bookstore up town, on a
salary of six dollars a week.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">ON THE FERRY-BOAT.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">Mark</span></span>
had made two applications for charity,
and still had but ten cents. The manner in which
Mrs. Crawford met his appeal made the business
seem more disagreeable than ever. Besides, he was
getting tired. It was not more than eight o'clock,
but he had been up early, and had been on his feet
all day. He leaned against one of the stalls, but
in so doing he aroused the suspicions of the vigilant
old woman who presided over it.</p>

<p>"Just stand away there," she said. "You're
watchin' for a chance to steal one of them apples."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," said Mark, indignantly. "I
never steal."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me," said the old woman, who had a
hearty aversion to boys, some of whom, it must be
confessed, had in times past played mean tricks on

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>

her; "don't tell me! Them that beg will steal,
and I see you beggin' just now."</p>

<p>To this Mark had no reply to make. He saw that
he was already classed with the young street beggars,
many of whom, as the old woman implied,
had no particular objection to stealing, if they got a
chance. Altogether he was so disgusted with his
new business, that he felt it impossible for him to
beg any more that night. But then came up the
consideration that this would prevent his returning
home. He very well knew what kind of a reception
Mother Watson would give him, and he had a very
unpleasant recollection and terror of the leather
strap.</p>

<p>But where should he go? He must pass the
night somewhere, and he already felt drowsy. Why
should he not follow Ben Gibson's suggestions, and
sleep on the Fulton ferry-boat? It would only
cost two cents to get on board, and he might ride all
night. Fortunately he had more than money enough
for that, though he did not like to think how he came
by the ten cents.</p>

<p>When Mark had made up his mind, he passed
out of one of the entrances of the market, and, crossing

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>

the street, presented his ten cents at the wicket,
where stood the fare-taker.</p>

<p>Without a look towards him, that functionary took
the money, and pushed back eight cents. These
Mark took, and passed round into the large room of
the ferry-house.</p>

<p>The boat was not in, but he already saw it halfway
across the river, speeding towards its pier.</p>

<p>There were a few persons waiting besides himself,
but the great rush of travel was diminished for a
short time. It would set in again about eleven
o'clock when those who had passed the evening at
some place of amusement in New York would be on
their way home.</p>

<p>Mark with the rest waited till the boat reached its
wharf. There was the usual bump, then the chain
rattled, the wheel went round, and the passengers
began to pour out upon the wharf. Mark passed
into the boat, and went at once to the "gentlemen's
cabin," situated on the left-hand side of the boat.
Generally, however, gentlemen rather unfairly crowd
into the ladies' cabin, sometimes compelling the
ladies, to whom it of right belongs, to stand, while
they complacently monopolize the seats. The gentlemen's

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>

cabin, so called, is occupied by those who
have a little more regard to the rights of ladies, and
by the smokers, who are at liberty to indulge in
their favorite comfort here.</p>

<p>When Mark entered, the air was redolent with
tobacco-smoke, generally emitted from clay pipes and
cheap cigars, and therefore not so agreeable as under
other circumstances it might have been. But it was
warm and comfortable, and that was a good deal.</p>

<p>In the corner Mark espied a wide seat nearly
double the size of an ordinary seat, and this he decided
would make the most comfortable niche for
him.</p>

<p>He settled himself down there as well as he could.
The seat was hard, and not so comfortable as it
might have been; but then Mark was not accustomed
to beds of down, and he was so weary that his eyes
closed and he was soon in the land of dreams.</p>

<p>He was dimly conscious of the arrival at the
Brooklyn side, and the ensuing hurried exit of passengers
from that part of the cabin in which he was,
but it was only a slight interruption, and when the
boat, having set out on its homeward trip, reached
the New York side, he was fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor little fellow!" thought more than one,
with a hasty glance at the sleeping boy. "He is
taking his comfort where he can."</p>

<p>But there was no good Samaritan to take him by
the hand, and inquire into his hardships, and provide
for his necessities, or rather there was one, and that
one well known to us.</p>

<p>Richard Hunter and his friend Henry Fosdick had
been to Brooklyn that evening to attend an instructive
lecture which they had seen announced in one of
the daily papers. The lecture concluded at half-past
nine, and they took the ten o'clock boat over
the Fulton ferry.</p>

<p>They seated themselves in the first cabin, towards
the Brooklyn side, and did not, therefore, see Mark
until they passed through the other cabin on the
arrival of the boat at New York.</p>

<p>"Look there, Fosdick," said Richard Hunter.
"See that poor little chap asleep in the corner.
Doesn't it remind you of the times we used to have,
when we were as badly off as he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dick, but I don't think I ever slept on a
ferry-boat."</p>

<p>"That's because you were not on the streets long

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>

I took care of myself eight years, and more than
once took a cheap bed for two cents on a boat like
this. Most likely I've slept in that very corner."</p>

<p>"It was a hard life, Dick."</p>

<p>"Yes, and a hard bed too; but there's a good
many that are no better off now. I always feel like
doing something to help along those like this little
chap here."</p>

<p>"I wonder what he is,&mdash;a boot-black?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't got any brush or box with him.
Perhaps he's a newsboy. I think I'll give him a
surprise."</p>

<p>"Wake him up, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"No, poor little chap! Let him sleep. I'll put
fifty cents in his pocket, and when he wakes up he
won't know where it came from."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, Dick. I'll do the same.
All right."</p>

<p>"Here's the money. Put mine in with yours.
Don't wake him up."</p>

<p>Dick walked softly up to the match boy, and
gently inserted the money&mdash;one dollar&mdash;in one of
the pockets of his ragged vest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark was so fast asleep that he was entirely
unconscious of the benevolent act.</p>

<p>"That'll make him open his eyes in the morning,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Unless somebody relieves him of the money
during his sleep."</p>

<p>"Not much chance of that. Pickpockets won't
be very apt to meddle with such a ragged little chap
as that, unless it's in a fit of temporary aberration of
mind."</p>

<p>"You're right, Dick. But we must hurry out
now, or we shall be carried back to Brooklyn."</p>

<p>"And so get more than our money's worth. I
wouldn't want to cheat the corporation so extensively
as that."</p>

<p>So the two friends passed out of the boat, and left
the match boy asleep in the cabin, quite unconscious
that good fortune had hovered over him, and made
him richer by a dollar, while he slept.</p>

<p>While we are waiting for him to awake, we may
as well follow Richard Hunter and his friend home.</p>

<p>Fosdick's good fortune, which we recorded in the
earlier chapters of this volume had made no particular
change in their arrangements. They were

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>

already living in better style than was usual among
youths situated as they were. There was this difference,
however, that whereas formerly Dick paid the
greater part of the joint expense it was now divided
equally. It will be remembered that Fosdick's
interest on the twenty bank shares purchased in his
name amounted to one hundred and sixty dollars
annually, and this just about enabled him to pay his
own way, though not leaving him a large surplus for
clothing and incidental expenses. It could not be
long, however, before his pay would be increased at
the store, probably by two dollars a week. Until
that time he could economize a little; for upon one
thing he had made up his mind,&mdash;not to trench upon
his principal except in case of sickness or absolute
necessity.</p>

<p>The boys had not forgotten or neglected the commission
which they had undertaken for Mr. Hiram
Bates. They had visited, on the evening after he
left, the Newsboys' Lodging House, then located at
the corner of Fulton and Nassau Streets, in the
upper part of the "Sun" building, and had consulted
Mr. O'Connor, the efficient superintendent, as to the
boy of whom they were in search. But he had no

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>

information to supply them with. He promised to
inquire among the boys who frequented the lodge,
as it was possible that there might be some among
them who might have fallen in with a boy named
Talbot.</p>

<p>Richard Hunter also sought out some of his old
acquaintances, who were still engaged in blacking
boots, or selling newspapers, and offered a reward of
five dollars for the discovery of a boy of ten, named
Talbot, or John Talbot.</p>

<p>As the result of this offer a red-haired boy was
brought round to the counting-room one day, who
stoutly asserted that his name was John Talbot,
and his guide in consequence claimed the reward.
Dick, however, had considerable doubt as to the
genuineness of this claim, and called the errand-boy,
known to the readers of earlier volumes, as Micky
Maguire.</p>

<p>"Micky," said Richard, "this boy says he is
John Talbot. Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Know him!" repeated Micky; "I've knowed
him ever since he was so high. He's no more John
Talbot than I am. His name is Tim Hogan, and I'll
defy him to say it isn't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Tim looked guilty, and his companion gave up the
attempt to obtain the promised reward. He had
hired Tim by the promise of a dollar to say he was
John Talbot, hoping by the means to clear four
dollars for himself.</p>

<p>"That boy'll rise to a seat in the Common Council
if he lives long enough," said Dick. "He's an
unusually promising specimen."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A PLEASANT DISCOVERY.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">The</span></span>
night wore away, and still Mark, the match
boy, continued to sleep soundly in the corner of the
cabin where he had established himself. One of
the boat hands passing through noticed him, and
was on the point of waking him, but, observing his
weary look and thin attire, refrained from an impulse
of compassion. He had a boy of about the
same age, and the thought came to him that some
time his boy might be placed in the same situation,
and this warmed his heart towards the little vagrant.</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to wake him up," he reflected,
"but he isn't doing any harm there, and he may
as well have his sleep out."</p>

<p>So Mark slept on,&mdash;a merciful sleep, in which
he forgot his poverty and friendless condition; a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>

sleep which brought new strength and refreshment
to his limbs.</p>

<p>When he woke up it was six o'clock in the morning.
But it was quite dark still, for it was in
December, and, so far as appearances went, it might
have been midnight. But already sleepy men and
boys were on their way to the great city to their
daily work. Some were employed a considerable
distance up town, and must be at their posts at
seven. Others were employed in the markets and
must be stirring at an early hour. There were
keepers of street-stands, who liked to be ready for
the first wave in the tide of daily travel that was to
sweep without interruption through the city streets
until late at night. So, altogether, even at this
early hour there was quite a number of passengers.</p>

<p>Mark rubbed his eyes, not quite sure where he
was, or how he got there. He half expected to hear
the harsh voice of Mother Watson, which usually
aroused him to his daily toil. But there was no
Mother Watson to be seen, only sleepy, gaping
men and boys, clad in working dresses.</p>

<p>Mark sat up and looked around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, young chap, you've had a nap, haven't
you?" said a man at his side, who appeared, from a
strong smell of paint about his clothes, to be a
journeyman painter.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark. "Is it morning?"</p>

<p>"To be sure it is. What did you expect it
was?"</p>

<p>"Then I've been sleeping all night," said the
match boy, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>"In that corner?" asked the painter.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark; "I came aboard last night,
and fell asleep, and that's the last I remember."</p>

<p>"It must be rather hard to the bones," said the
painter. "I think that I should prefer a regular
bed."</p>

<p>"I do feel rather sore," said the match boy;
"but I slept bully."</p>

<p>"A little chap like you can curl up anywhere.
I don't think I could sleep very well on these seats.
Haven't you got any home?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark, "a sort of a home."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you sleep at home?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew I should get a beating if I went home
without twenty-five cents."</p>

<p>"Well, that's hard luck. I wonder how I should
feel," he continued, laughing, "if my wife gave me
a beating when I came home short of funds."</p>

<p>But here the usual bump indicated the arrival of
the boat at the slip, and all the passengers, the
painter included, rose, and hurried to the edge of
the boat.</p>

<p>With the rest went Mark. He had no particular
object in going thus early; but his sleep was over,
and there was no inducement to remain longer in the
boat.</p>

<p>The rain was over also. The streets were still
wet from the effects of the quantity that had fallen,
but there was no prospect of any more. Mark's
wet clothes had dried in the warm, dry atmosphere of
the cabin, and he felt considerably better than on the
evening previous.</p>

<p>Now, however, he could not help wondering what
Mother Watson had thought of his absence.</p>

<p>"She'll be mad, I know," he thought. "I suppose
she'll whip me when I get back."</p>

<p>This certainly was not a pleasant thought. The

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>

leather strap was an old enemy of his, which he
dreaded, and with good reason. He was afraid that
he would get a more severe beating, for not having
returned the night before, at the hands of the angry
old woman.</p>

<p>"I wish I didn't live with Mother Watson," he
thought.</p>

<p>Straight upon this thought came another." Why
should he?"</p>

<p>Mother Watson had no claim upon him. Upon
his mother's death she had assumed the charge of
him, but, as it turned out, rather for her own advantage
than his. She had taken all his earnings, and
given him in return a share of her miserable apartment,
a crust of bread or two, daily seasoned with
occasional assaults with the leather strap. It had
never occurred to Mark before, but now for the first
time it dawned upon him that he had the worst of
the bargain. He could live more comfortably by
retaining his earnings, and spending them upon himself.</p>

<p>Mark was rather a timid, mild-mannered boy, or
he would sooner have rebelled against the tyranny
and abuse of Mother Watson. But he had had little

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>

confidence in himself, and wanted somebody to
lean on. In selecting the old woman, who had
acted thus far as his guardian, he had leaned upon
a broken reed. The last night's experience gave
him a little courage. He reflected that he could
sleep in the Newsboys' Lodging House for five cents,
or on the ferry-boat again for two, while the fare at
his old home was hardly so sumptuous but that he
could obtain the same without very large expense.</p>

<p>So Mark thought seriously of breaking his yoke
and declaring himself free and independent. A
discovery which he made confirmed him in his half-formed
resolution.</p>

<p>He remembered that after paying his toll he had
eight cents left, which he had placed in his vest-pocket.
He thought that these would enable him to
get some breakfast, and drew them out. To his
astonishment there were two silver half-dollars
mingled with the coppers. Mark opened his eyes
wide in astonishment. Where could they have come
from? Was it possible that the tollman had given
him them by mistake for pennies? That could not
be, for two reasons: First, he remembered looking
at the change as it was handed him, and he knew

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>

that there were no half-dollars among them. Again,
the eight pennies were all there, the silver coins
making the number ten.</p>

<p>It was certainly very strange and surprising, and
puzzled Mark not a little. We, who know all about
it, find the explanation very easy, but to the little
match boy it was an unfathomable mystery.</p>

<p>The surprise, however, was of an agreeable character.
With so much money in his possession, Mark
felt like a man with a handsome balance at his
banker's, and with the usual elasticity of youth he
did not look forward to the time when this supply
would be exhausted.</p>

<p>"I won't go back to Mother Watson," he determined.
"She's beaten me times enough. I'll
take care of myself."</p>

<p>While these thoughts were passing through his
mind, he had walked up Fulton Street, and reached
the corner of Nassau. Here he met his friend of
the night before, Ben Gibson.</p>

<p>Ben looked rather sleepy. He had been at the
Old Bowery Theatre the night before until twelve
o'clock, and, having no money left to invest in a
night's lodging, he had crept into a corner of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>

"Times" printing office, and slept, but had not quite
slept off his fatigue.</p>

<p>"Hallo, young 'un!" said he. "Where did you
come from?"</p>

<p>"From Fulton Ferry," said Mark. "I slept on
the boat."</p>

<p>"Did you? How'd you like it?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good," said Mark. "It was rather
hard."</p>

<p>"How'd you make out begging?"</p>

<p>"Not very well. I got ten cents."</p>

<p>"So you didn't dare to go home to the old
woman?"</p>

<p>"I shan't go home there any more," said the
match boy.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Bully for you! I like your pluck. I wouldn't
go back and get a licking, if I were you. What'll
Mother Watson say?"</p>

<p>"She'll be mad, I expect," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Keep a sharp lookout for her. I'll tell you
what you can do: stay near me, and if she comes
prowlin' round I'll manage her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Could you?" said Mark, quickly, who, from
certain recollections, had considerable fear of his
stout tyrant.</p>

<p>"You may just bet on that. What you goin' to
do?"</p>

<p>"I think I shall go and get some breakfast," said
Mark.</p>

<p>"So would I, if I had any tin; but I'm dead
broke,&mdash;spent my last cent goin' to the Old Bowery.
I'll have to wait till I've had one or two shines
before I can eat breakfast."</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet I am."</p>

<p>"Because," said Mark, hesitating, "I'll lend
you money enough for breakfast, and you can pay
me when you earn it."</p>

<p>"You lend me money!" exclaimed Ben, in
astonishment. "Why, you haven't got but eight
cents."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," said Mark, producing the two half-dollars.</p>

<p>"Where'd you get them?" asked the boot-black,
in unfeigned surprise, looking at Mark as if he had
all at once developed into an Astor or a Stewart.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>

"You haven't been begging this morning, have
you?"</p>

<p>"No," said the match boy, "and I don't mean to
beg again if I can help it."</p>

<p>"Then where'd you get the money?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Don't know! You haven't been stealin', have
you?"</p>

<p>Mark disclaimed the imputation indignantly.</p>

<p>"Then you found a pocket-book?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't."</p>

<p>"Then where did you get the money?"</p>

<p>"I don't know any more than you do. When I
went to sleep on the boat I didn't have it, but this
morning when I felt in my pocket it was there."</p>

<p>"That's mighty queer," said Ben, whistling.</p>

<p>"So I think."</p>

<p>"It's good money, aint it?"</p>

<p>"Try it and see."</p>

<p>Ben tossed up one of the coins. It fell with a
clear, ringing sound on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's good," he said. "I just wish somebody'd
treat me that way. Maybe it's the vest?
If 'tis I'd like to buy it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think it's that," said Mark, laughing.</p>

<p>"Anyway you've got the money. I'll borrow
twenty cents of you, and we'll go and get some breakfast."</p>

<p class="center">ON THE WAR PATH.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">Ben</span></span>
led the way to a cheap restaurant, where for
eighteen cents each of the boys got a breakfast, which
to their not very fastidious tastes proved very satisfactory.</p>

<p>"There," said Ben, with a sigh of satisfaction, as
they rose from the table, "now I feel like work; I'll
pay up that money afore night."</p>

<p>"All right," said Mark.</p>

<p>"What are you goin' to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mark, irresolutely.</p>

<p>"You're a match boy,&mdash;aint you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where's your matches?"</p>

<p>"In Mother Watson's room."</p>

<p>"You might go and get 'em when she's out."</p>

<p>"No," said Mark, shaking his head. "I won't do
that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not? You aint afraid to go round there,&mdash;be
you?"</p>

<p>"It isn't that,&mdash;but the matches are hers, not
mine."</p>

<p>"What's the odds?"</p>

<p>"I won't take anything of hers."</p>

<p>"Well, you can buy some of your own, then.
You've got money enough."</p>

<p>"So I will," said Mark. "It's lucky that money
came to me in my sleep."</p>

<p>"That's a lucky boat. I guess I'll go there and
sleep to-night."</p>

<p>Mark did as he proposed. With the money he
had he was able to purchase a good supply of matches,
and when it became light enough he began to
vend them.</p>

<p>Hitherto he had not been very fortunate in the
disposal of his wares, being timid and bashful; but
then he was working for Mother Watson, and expected
to derive very little advantage for himself from
his labors. Now he was working for himself, and
this seemed to put new spirit and courage into him.
Then again he felt that he had shaken off the hateful
thraldom in which Mother Watson had held him, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>

this gave him a hopefulness which he had not before
possessed.</p>

<p>The consequence was that at noon he found that
he had earned forty cents in addition to his investment.
At that time, too, Ben was ready to pay him
his loan, so that Mark found himself twenty-two
cents better off than he had been in the morning, having
a capital of a dollar and thirty cents, out of
which, however, he must purchase his dinner.</p>

<p>While he is getting on in such an encouraging
manner we must go back to Mother Watson.</p>

<p>When Mark did not return the night before she
grumbled considerably, but no thought of his intentional
desertion dawned upon her. Indeed, she
counted upon his timidity and lack of courage, knowing
well that a more spirited boy would have broken
her chain long before. She only thought, therefore,
that he had not got the twenty-five cents, and did
not dare to come back, especially as she had forbidden
him to do so.</p>

<p>So, determining to give him a taste of the leather
strap in the morning, she went to bed, first taking a
fresh potation from the whiskey bottle, which was her
constant companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Late in the morning Mother Watson woke, feeling
as usual, at that hour of the day, cross and uncomfortable,
and with a strong desire to make some one else
uncomfortable. But Mark, whom she usually made
to bear the burden of her temper, was still away.
For the first time the old woman began to feel a little
apprehensive that he had deserted her. This was far
from suiting her, as she found his earnings very convenient,
and found it besides pleasant to have somebody
to scold.</p>

<p>She hastily dressed, without paying much attention
to her toilet. Indeed, to do Mother Watson justice,
her mind was far from being filled with the vanity
of dress, and if she erred on that subject it was in
the opposite extreme.</p>

<p>When her simple toilet was accomplished she went
downstairs, and knocked at Mrs. Flanagan's door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" said a hearty voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanagan was hard at work at her wash-tub,
and had been for a good couple of hours. She raised
her good-natured face as the old woman entered.</p>

<p>"The top of the morning to you, Mother Watson,"
she said. "I hope you're in fine health this
morning, mum."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you'll be disappointed," said Mrs. Watson.
"I've got a bad feeling at my stomach, and have it
most every morning."</p>

<p>"It's the whiskey," thought Mrs. Flanagan; but
she thought it best not to intimate as much, as it
might lead to hostilities.</p>

<p>"Better take a cup of tea," said she.</p>

<p>"I haven't got any," said the old woman. "I
wouldn't mind a sup if you've got some handy."</p>

<p>"Sit down then," said Mrs. Flanagan, hospitably.
"I've got some left from breakfast, only it's cold,
but if you'll wait a bit, I'll warm it over for
you."</p>

<p>Nothing loth, Mother Watson sank into a chair,
and began to give a full account of her ailments to
her neighbor, who tried hard to sympathize with her,
though, knowing the cause of the ailments, she found
this rather difficult.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of my boy this morning?"
she asked after a while.</p>

<p>"What, Mark?" said Mrs. Flanagan. "Didn't
he come home last night?"</p>

<p>"No," said the old woman, "and he isn't home
yet. When he does come I'll give him a dose of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>

strap. He's a bad, lazy, shiftless boy, and worries
my life out."</p>

<p>"You're hard on the poor boy, Mother Watson.
You must remember he's but a wisp of a lad, and
hasn't much strength."</p>

<p>"He's strong enough," muttered Mother Watson.
"It's lazy he is. Just let him come home, that's
all!"</p>

<p>"You told him not to come home unless he had
twenty-five cents to bring with him."</p>

<p>"So I did, and why didn't he do it?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't get the money, it's likely, and he's
afraid of bein' bate."</p>

<p>"Well, he will be bate then, Mrs. Flanagan, you
may be sure of that," said the old woman, diving
her hand into her pocket to see that the strap was
safe.</p>

<p>"Then you're a bad, cruel woman, to bate that
poor motherless child," said Mrs. Flanagan, with
spirit.</p>

<p>"Say that again, Mrs. Flanagan," ejaculated
Mother Watson, irefully. "My hearin' isn't as
good as it was, and maybe I didn't hear you right."</p>

<p>"No wonder your hearin' isn't good," said Mrs.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>

Flanagan, who now broke bounds completely. "I
shouldn't think you'd have any sense left with the
whiskey you drink."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you mean to insult me," said the old
woman, glaring at her hostess with one of the frowns
which used to send terror to the heart of poor Mark.</p>

<p>"Take it as you please, mum," said Mrs. Flanagan,
intrepidly. "I'm entirely willin'. I've been
wanting to spake my mind a long while, and now I've
spoke it."</p>

<p>Mother Watson clutched the end of the strap in
her pocket, and eyed her hostess with a half wish that
it would do to treat her as she had treated Mark so
often; but Mrs. Flanagan with her strong arms and
sturdy frame looked like an antagonist not very easily
overcome, and Mrs. Watson forbore, though unwillingly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tea was beginning to emit quite a
savory odor, and the wily old woman thought it best
to change her tactics.</p>

<p>Accordingly she burst into tears, and, rocking
backward and forward, declared that she was a miserable
old woman, and hadn't a friend in the world,
and succeeded in getting up such a display of misery

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>

that the soft heart of Mrs. Flanagan was touched,
and she apologized for the unpleasant personal observations
she had made, and hoped Mother Watson
would take the tea.</p>

<p>To this Mother Watson finally agreed, and intimating
that she was faint, Mrs. Flanagan made some
toast for her, of which the cunning old woman partook
with exceeding relish, notwithstanding her state
of unhappiness.</p>

<p>"Come in any time, Mother Watson," said Mrs.
Flanagan, "when you want a sip of tea, and I'll be
glad to have you take some with me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Flanagan; maybe I'll look in
once in a while. A sip of tea goes to the right spot
when I feel bad at my stomach."</p>

<p>"Must you be goin', Mother Watson?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old woman; "I'm goin' out on a
little walk, to see my sister that keeps a candy-stand
by the Park railins. If Mark comes in, will you
tell him he'll find the matches upstairs?"</p>

<p>This Mrs. Flanagan promised to do, and the old
woman went downstairs, and into the street.</p>

<p>But she had not stated her object quite correctly.
It was true that she had a sister, who was in the confectionery

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>

and apple line, presiding over one of the
stalls beside the Park railings. But the two sisters
were not on very good terms, chiefly because the
candy merchant, who was more industrious and correct
in her habits than her sister, declined to lend
money to Mother Watson,&mdash;a refusal which led to a
perfect coolness between them. It was not therefore
to see her that the old woman went out. She wanted
to find Mark. She did not mean to lose her hold
upon him, if there was any chance of retaining it,
and she therefore made up her mind to visit the
places where he was commonly to be found, and, when
found, to bring him home, by violence, if necessary.</p>

<p>So with an old plaid cloak depending from her
broad shoulders, and her hand grasping the strap in
her pocket, she made her way to the square, peering
about on all sides with her ferret-like eyes in the
hope of discovering the missing boy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">MARK'S VICTORY.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span></span>
Mark, rejoicing in his new-found freedom,
had started on a business walk among the stores
and offices at the lower part of Nassau Street, and
among the law and banking offices of Wall Street.
Fortunately for Mark there had been a rise in stocks,
and Wall Street was in a good-humor. So a few of
the crumbs from the tables of the prosperous bankers
and brokers fell in his way. One man, who had just
realized ten thousand dollars on a rise in some railway
securities, handed Mark fifty cents, but declined
to take any of his wares. So this was all clear
profit and quite a windfall for the little match boy.
Again, in one or two cases he received double price
for some of his matches, and the result was that he
found himself by eleven o'clock the possessor of two
dollars and a quarter, with a few boxes of matches
still left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark could hardly realize his own good fortune.
Somehow it seemed a great deal more profitable as
well as more agreeable to be in business for himself,
than to be acting as the agent of Mother Watson.
Mark determined that he would never go back to her
unless he was actually obliged to do so.</p>

<p>He wanted somebody to sympathize with him in
his good fortune, and, as he had nearly sold out, he
determined to hunt up Ben Gibson, and inform him
of his run of luck.</p>

<p>Ben, as he knew, was generally to be found on
Nassau Street, somewhere near the corner of Spruce
Street. He therefore turned up Nassau Street from
Wall, and in five minutes he reached the business
stand of his friend Ben.</p>

<p>Ben had just finished up a job as Mark came up.
His patron was a young man of verdant appearance,
who, it was quite evident, hailed from the country.
He wore a blue coat with brass buttons, and a tall
hat in the style of ten years before, with an immense
top. He gazed with complacency at the fine polish
which Ben had imparted to his boots,&mdash;a pair of
stout cowhides,&mdash;and inquired with an assumption
of indifference:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, boy, what's the tax?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five cents," said Ben, coolly.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five cents!" ejaculated the customer,
with a gasp of amazement. "Come now, you're
jokin'."</p>

<p>"No, I aint," said Ben.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you charge twenty-five
cents for five minutes' work?"</p>

<p>"Reg'lar price," said Ben.</p>

<p>"Why I don't get but twelve and a half cents an
hour when I work out hayin'," said the young man
in a tone expressive of his sense of the unfairness of
the comparative compensation.</p>

<p>"Maybe you don't have to pay a big license,"
said Ben.</p>

<p>"A license for blackin' boots?" ejaculated the
countryman, in surprise.</p>

<p>"In course. I have to deposit five hundred dollars,
more or less, in the city treasury, before I can
black boots."</p>

<p>"Five&mdash;hundred&mdash;dollars!" repeated the customer,
opening his eyes wide at the information.</p>

<p>"In course," said Ben. "If I didn't they'd put
me in jail for a year."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"And does he pay a license too?" asked the
countryman, pointing to Mark, who had just come up.</p>

<p>"He only has to pay two hundred and fifty dollars,"
said Ben. "They aint so hard on him as on us."</p>

<p>The young man drew out his wallet reluctantly,
and managed to raise twenty-three cents, which he
handed to Ben.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have had my boots blacked, if I'd
known the price," he said. "I could have blacked
'em myself at home. They didn't cost but three dollars,
and it don't pay to give twenty-five cents to
have 'em blacked."</p>

<p>"It'll make 'em last twice as long," said Ben.
"My blackin' is the superiorest kind, and keeps
boots from wearin' out."</p>

<p>"I havn't got the other two cents," said the young
man. "Aint that near enough?"</p>

<p>"It'll do," said Ben, magnanimously, "seein' you
didn't know the price."</p>

<p>The victimized customer walked away, gratified to
have saved the two cents, but hardly reconciled to
have expended almost quarter of a dollar on a piece
of work which he might have done himself before
leaving home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what luck, Mark?" said Ben. "I took
in that chap neat, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"But you didn't tell the truth," said Mark. "You
don't have to buy a license."</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the odds?" said Ben, whose ideas on
the subject of truth were far from being strict. "It's
all fair in business. Didn't that chap open his eyes
when I told him about payin' five hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it's right, Ben," said Mark, seriously.</p>

<p>"Don't you go to preachin', Mark," said Ben, not
altogether pleased. "You've been tied to an old
woman's apron-string too long,&mdash;that's what's the
matter with you."</p>

<p>"Mother Watson didn't teach me the truth," said
Mark. "She don't care whether I tell it or not except
to her. It was my mother that told me I ought
always to tell the truth."</p>

<p>"Women don't know anything about business,"
said Ben. "Nobody in business speaks the truth.
Do you see that sign?"</p>

<p>Mark looked across the street, and saw a large
placard, setting forth that a stock of books and stationery
was selling off at less than cost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you believe that?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's true," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Then you're jolly green, that's all I've got to
lay," said Ben. "But you haven't told me how
much you've made."</p>

<p>"See here," said Mark, and he drew out his stock
of money.</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Ben, in amazement. "You're
in luck. I guess you've been speculatin' on your
license too."</p>

<p>"No," said Mark; "one gentleman gave me fifty
cents, and two others paid me double price."</p>

<p>"Why, you're gettin' rich!" said Ben. "Aint
you glad you've left the old woman?"</p>

<p>But just then Mark lifted up his eyes, and saw a
sight that blanched his cheek. There, bearing down
upon him, and already but a few feet distant, was
Mother Watson! She was getting over the ground
as fast as her stoutness would allow. She had already
caught sight of Mark, and her inflamed eyes
were sparkling with triumphant joy. Mark saw
with terror that her hand was already feeling in the
pocket where she kept the leather strap. Much as
he always feared the strap, the idea of having it applied

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>

to him in the public street made it even more
distasteful.</p>

<p>"What shall I do, Ben?" he said, clutching the
arm of his companion.</p>

<p>"What are you afraid of? Do you see a copp
after you?"</p>

<p>A "copp" is the street-boy's name for a policeman.</p>

<p>"No," said Mark; "there's Mother Watson coming
after me. Don't you see her?"</p>

<p>"That's Mother Watson, is it?" asked Ben, surveying
the old body with a critical eye. "She's a
beauty, she is!"</p>

<p>"What shall I do, Ben? She'll beat me."</p>

<p>"No, she won't," said Ben. "You just keep quiet,
and leave her to me. Don't be afraid. She shan't
touch you."</p>

<p>"She might strike you," said Mark, apprehensively.</p>

<p>"She'd better not!" said Ben, very decidedly;
"not unless she wants to be landed in the middle of
next week at very short notice."</p>

<p>By this time Mother Watson came up, puffing and
panting with the extraordinary efforts she had made

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>

She could not speak at first, but stood and glared at
the match boy in a vindictive way.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, old lady?" asked
Ben, coolly. "You aint took sick, be you? I'd
offer to support your delicate form, but I'm afraid
you'd be too much for me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by runnin' away from home,
you little thief?" said the old woman, at length
regaining her breath. Of course her remark was
addressed to Mark.</p>

<p>"You're very polite, old lady," said Ben; "but
I've adopted that boy, and he's goin' to live with me
now."</p>

<p>"I aint speakin' to you, you vagabone!" said
Mother Watson, "so you needn't give me no more of
your impertinence. I'm a-speakin' to him."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to live with you any more," said
Mark, gaining a little courage from the coolness of
his friend, the boot-black.</p>

<p>"Aint a goin' to live with me?" gasped the old
woman, who could hardly believe she heard aright.
"Come right away, sir, or I'll drag you home."</p>

<p>"Don't you stir, Mark," said Ben.</p>

<p>Mother Watson drew out her strap, and tried to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>

get at the match boy, but Ben put himself persistently
in her way.</p>

<p>"Clear out, you vagabone!" said the old lady,
"or I'll give you something to make you quiet."</p>

<p>"You'd better keep quiet yourself," said Ben, not
in the least frightened. "Don't you be afraid,
Mark. If she kicks up a rumpus, I'll give her over
to a copp. He'll settle her."</p>

<p>Mother Watson by this time was very much incensed.
She pulled out her strap, and tried to get
at Mark, but the boot-black foiled her efforts constantly.</p>

<p>Carried away with anger, she struck Ben with the
strap.</p>

<p>"Look here, old lady," said Ben, "that's goin' a
little too far. You won't use that strap again;" and
with a dexterous and vigorous grasp he pulled it out
of her hand.</p>

<p>"Give me that strap, you vagabone!" screamed
the old woman, furiously.</p>

<p>"Look here, old lady, what are you up to?"
demanded the voice of one having authority.</p>

<p>Mother Watson, turning round, saw an object for
which she never had much partiality,&mdash;a policeman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"O sir," said she, bursting into maudlin tears,
"it's my bad boy that I want to come home, and he
won't come."</p>

<p>"Which is your boy,&mdash;that one?" asked the
policeman, pointing to Ben Gibson.</p>

<p>"No, not that vagabone!" said the old woman,
spitefully. "I wouldn't own him. It's that other
boy."</p>

<p>"Do you belong to her?" asked the officer, addressing
Mark.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the match boy.</p>

<p>"He does," vociferated the old woman.</p>

<p>"Is he your son?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, after a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>"Is he any relation of yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's my nephew," said Mother Watson,
making up her mind to a falsehood as the only means
of recovering Mark.</p>

<p>"Is this true?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," said Mark. "She's no relation
to me, but when my mother died she offered to take
care of me. Instead of that she's half starved me,
and beaten me with a strap when I didn't bring
home as much money as she wanted."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you don't want to go back with her?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm going to take care of myself."</p>

<p>"Is there anybody that will prove the truth of
what you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark, "I'll call Mrs. Flanagan."</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"She lives in the same house with us."</p>

<p>"Shall he call her, or will you give him up?"
asked the officer. "By the way, I think you're the
same woman I saw drunk in the street last week."</p>

<p>Mother Watson took alarm at this remark, and,
muttering that it was hard upon a poor widder woman
to take her only nephew from her, shuffled off, leaving
Mark and Ben in full possession of the field, with
the terrible strap thrown in as a trophy of the victory
they had won.</p>

<p>"I know her of old," said the policeman. "I
guess you'll do as well without her as with her."</p>

<p>Satisfied that there would be no more trouble, he
resumed his walk, and Mark felt that now in truth
he was free and independent.</p>

<p>As Mother Watson will not reappear in this
story, it may be said that only a fortnight later she
was arrested for an assault upon her sister, the proprietor

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>

of the apple-stand, from whom she had endeavored
in vain to extort a loan, and was sentenced
to the island for a period of three months, during
which she ceased to grace metropolitan society.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE NEWSBOYS' LODGING HOUSE.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">When</span></span>
Mother Watson had turned the corner,
Mark breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Don't you think she'll come back again?" he
asked anxiously of Ben Gibson.</p>

<p>"No," said Ben, "she's scared of the copp. If
she ever catches you alone, and tries to come any of
her games, just call a copp, and she'll be in a hurry
to leave."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mark, "I guess I'll try to sell the
rest of my matches. I haven't got but a few."</p>

<p>"All right; I'll try for another shine, and then
we'll go and have some dinner. I'd like to get hold
of another greeny."</p>

<p>Mark started with his few remaining matches.
The feeling that he was his own master, and had a
little hoard of money for present expenses, gave him
courage, and he was no longer deterred by his usual

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>

timidity. In an hour he had succeeded in getting
rid of all his matches, and he was now the possessor
of two dollars and seventy-five cents, including the
money Ben Gibson owed him. Ben also was lucky
enough to get two ten-cent customers, which helped
his receipts by twenty cents. Ben, it may be remarked,
was not an advocate of the one-price system.
He blacked boots for five cents when he could get no
more. When he thought there was a reasonable
prospect of getting ten cents, that was his price.
Sometimes, as in the case of the young man from the
rural districts, he advanced his fee to twenty-five
cents. I don't approve Ben's system for my part.
I think it savors considerably of sharp practice, and
that fair prices in the long run are the best for all
parties.</p>

<p>The boys met again at one o'clock, and adjourned
to a cheap underground restaurant on Nassau Street,
where they obtained what seemed to them a luxurious
meal of beefsteak, with a potato, a small plate
of bread, and a cup of what went by the name of
coffee. The steak was not quite up to the same
article at Delmonico's, and there might be some
reasonable doubts as to whether the coffee was a genuine

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>

article; but as neither of the boys knew the difference,
we may quote Ben's familiar phrase, and
say, "What's the odds?"</p>

<p>Indeed, the free and easy manner in which Ben
threw himself back in his chair, and the condescending
manner in which he assured the waiter that the
steak was "a prime article," could hardly have been
surpassed in the most aristocratic circles.</p>

<p>"Well, Mark, have you had enough?" asked
Ben.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't," said Ben. "I guess I'll
have some puddin'. Look here, Johnny," to the
colored waiter, "just bring a feller a plate of apple
dump with both kinds of sauce."</p>

<p>After giving this liberal order Ben tilted his chair
back, and began to pick his teeth with his fork. He
devoted himself with assiduity to the consumption of
the pudding, and concluded his expensive repast by
the purchase of a two-cent cigar, with which he
ascended to the street.</p>

<p>"Better have a cigar, Mark," he said.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said the match boy. "I think
I'd rather not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you're feared of being sick. You'll come to
it in time. All business men smoke."</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to dwell upon the events of the
afternoon. Mark was satisfied with the result of his
morning's work, and waited about with Ben till the
close of the afternoon, when the question came up,
as to where the night should be passed.</p>

<p>"I guess we'd better go to the Lodge," said Ben.
"Were you ever there?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Well, come along. They'll give us a jolly bed,
all for six cents, and there's a good, warm room to
stay in. Then we can get breakfast in the mornin'
for six cents more."</p>

<p>"All right," said Mark. "We'll go."</p>

<p>The down-town Newsboys' Lodging House was at
that time located at the corner of Fulton and Nassau
Streets. It occupied the fifth and sixth stories of
the building then known as the "Sun" building, owned
by Moses S. Beach, the publisher of that journal.
In the year 1868 circumstances rendered it expedient
to remove the Lodge to a building in Park
Place. It is to be hoped that at some day not far
distant the Children's Aid Society, who carry on this

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>

beneficent institution, will be able to erect a building
of their own in some eligible locality, which can be
permanently devoted to a purpose so praiseworthy.</p>

<p>Ben and Mark soon reached the entrance to the
Lodge on Fulton Street. They ascended several
flights of narrow stairs till they reached the top
story. Then, opening a door at the left, they found
themselves in the main room of the Lodge. It was
a low-studded room of considerable dimensions, amply
supplied with windows, looking out on Fulton and
Nassau Streets. At the side nearest the door was a
low platform, separated from the rest of the room by
a railing. On this platform were a table and two or
three chairs. This was the place for the superintendent,
and for gentlemen who from time to time address
the boys.</p>

<p>The superintendent at that time was Mr. Charles
O'Connor, who still retains the office. Probably no
one could be found better adapted to the difficult task
of managing the class of boys who avail themselves
of the good offices of the Newsboys' Home. His
mild yet firm manner, and more than all the conviction
that he is their friend, and feels a hearty interest
in their welfare, secure a degree of decorum and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>

good behavior which could hardly be anticipated.
Oaths and vulgar speech, however common in the
street, are rarely heard here, or, if heard, meet with
instant rebuke.</p>

<p>The superintendent was in the room when Ben
and Mark entered.</p>

<p>"Well, Ben, what luck have you had to-day?"
said Mr. O'Connor.</p>

<p>"Pretty good," said Ben.</p>

<p>"And who is that with you?"</p>

<p>"Mother Watson's nephew," said Ben, with a
grimace.</p>

<p>"He's only joking, sir," said Mark. "My name
is Mark Manton."</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, Mark," said the superintendent.
"What is your business?"</p>

<p>"I sell matches, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you parents living?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; they are both dead."</p>

<p>"Where have you been living?"</p>

<p>"In Vandewater Street."</p>

<p>"With any one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with a woman they call Mother Watson."</p>

<p>"Is she a relation of yours?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir," said Mark, hastily.</p>

<p>"What sort of a woman is she?"</p>

<p>"Bad enough, sir. She gets drunk about every
day and used to beat me with a strap when I did
not bring home as much money as she expected."</p>

<p>"So you have left her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been up here before?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know the rules of the place."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; Ben has told me."</p>

<p>"You had better go and wash. We shall have
supper pretty quick. Have you any money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Mark took out his hoard of money, and showed it
to the superintendent, who was surprised at the
amount.</p>

<p>"How did you get so much?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Part of it was given me," said Mark.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with it? You don't
need it all?"</p>

<p>"Will you keep it for me, sir?"</p>

<p>"I will put as much of it as you can spare into
the bank for you. This is our bank."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>He pointed to a table beside the railing on the outside.
The top of it was pierced with narrow slits,
each having a number attached. Each compartment
was assigned to any boy who desired it, and his daily
earnings were dropped in at the end of the day.
Once a month the bank was opened, and the depositor
was at liberty to withdraw his savings if he desired
it. This is an excellent arrangement, as it has
a tendency to teach frugal habits to the young
patrons of the Lodge. Extravagance is one of their
besetting sins. Many average a dollar and over as
daily earnings, yet are always ragged and out at
elbows, and often are unsupplied with the small price
of a night's lodging at the Home. The money is
squandered on gambling, cigars, and theatre-going,
while the same sum would make them comfortable
and independent of charity. The disposition to save
is generally the first encouraging symptom in a
street boy, and shows that he has really a desire to
rise above his circumstances, and gain a respectable
position in the world.</p>

<p>Ben, who had long frequented the Lodging
House off and on, led the way to the washing-room,
where Mark, to his satisfaction, was able to cleanse

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>

himself from the dust and impurity of the street.
At Mother Watson's he had had no accommodations
of the kind, as the old lady was not partial to water
either internally or externally. He was forced to
snatch such opportunities as he could find.</p>

<p>"Now," said Ben, "we'll go into the gymnasium."</p>

<p>A room opposite the main room had been fitted up
with a few of the principal appliances of a gymnasium,
and these were already in use by quite a number
of boys.</p>

<p>Mark looked on, but did not participate, partly
from bashfulness, and partly because he did not very
well understand the use of the different appliances.</p>

<p>"How do you like it?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"Very much," said Mark, with satisfaction. "I'm
glad you brought me here."</p>

<p>"I'll show you the beds by and by," said Ben.</p>

<p>The rooms on the floor below were used for lodging.
Tiers of neat beds, some like those in a steamboat
or a hospital, filled a large room. They were
very neat in appearance, and looked comfortable.
In order to insure their continuing neat, the superintendent

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>

requires such as need it to wash their feet
before retiring to bed.</p>

<p>The supper was of course plain, but of good quality
and sufficient quantity.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock Mark got into the neat bed
which was assigned him, and felt that it was more
satisfactory even than the cabin of a Brooklyn ferry-boat.
He slept peacefully except towards morning,
when he dreamed that his old persecutor, Mother
Watson, was about to apply the dreaded strap. He
woke up terrified, but soon realized with deep satisfaction
that he was no longer in her clutches.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">WHAT BEFELL THE MATCH BOY.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">During</span></span>
the next three months Mark made his
home at the Lodging House. He was easily able to
meet the small charges of the Lodge for bed and
breakfast, and saved up ten dollars besides in the
bank. Ben Gibson began to look upon him as quite
a capitalist.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you save up so much money,
Mark," he said. "You don't earn more'n half as
much as I do."</p>

<p>"It's because you spend so much, Ben. It costs
you considerable for cigars and such things, you
know, and then you go to the Old Bowery pretty
often."</p>

<p>"A feller must have some fun," said Ben.
"They've got a tearin' old play at the Bowery now.
You'd better come to-night."</p>

<p>Mark shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"I feel pretty tired when it comes night," he
said. "I'd rather stay at home."</p>

<p>"You aint so tough as I am," said Ben.</p>

<p>"No," said Mark, "I don't feel very strong. I
think something's the matter with me."</p>

<p>"Nothin' aint ever the matter with me," said
Ben, complacently; "but you're a puny little chap,
that look as if you might blow away some day."</p>

<p>It was now April, and the weather was of that
mild character that saps the strength and produces
a feeling of weakness and debility. Mark had been
exposed during the winter to the severity of stormy
weather, and more than once got thoroughly drenched.
It was an exposure that Ben would only have
laughed at, but Mark was slightly built, without
much strength of constitution, and he had been
feeling very languid for a few days, so that it was
with an effort that he dragged himself round during
the day with his little bundle of matches.</p>

<p>This conversation with Ben took place in the
morning just as both boys were going to work.</p>

<p>They separated at the City Hall Park, Ben finding
a customer in front of the "Times" building, while
Mark, after a little deliberation, decided to go on to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>

Pearl Street with his matches. He had visited the
offices in most of the lower streets, but this was a
new region to him, and he thought he might meet
with better success there. So he kept on his
way.</p>

<p>The warm sun and the sluggish air made his head
ache, and he felt little disposition to offer his wares
for sale. He called at one or two offices, but effected
no sales. At length he reached a large warehouse
with these names displayed on the sign over
the door:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="large">"ROCKWELL &amp; COOPER."<br /></span>
</p>

<p>This, as the reader will remember, was the establishment
in which Richard Hunter, formerly
Ragged Dick, was now book-keeper.</p>

<p>At this point a sudden faintness came over Mark,
and he sank to the ground insensible.</p>

<p>A moment before Richard Hunter handed a couple
of letters to the office boy,&mdash;known to the readers
of the earlier volumes in this series as Micky
Maguire,&mdash;and said, "Michael, I should like to
have you carry these at once to the post-office. On

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>

the way you may stop at Trescott &amp; Wayne's, and
get this bill cashed, if possible."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Hunter," said Michael, respectfully.</p>

<p>Richard Hunter and Micky Maguire had been
boot-blacks together, and had had more than one contest
for the supremacy. They had been sworn
enemies, and Micky had done his utmost to injure
Richard, but the latter, by his magnanimity, had finally
wholly overcome the antipathy of his former foe,
and, when opportunity offered, had lifted him to a
position in the office where he was himself employed.
In return, Micky had become an enthusiastic admirer
of Richard, and, so far from taking advantage of their
former relations, had voluntarily taken up the habit
of addressing him as Mr. Hunter.</p>

<p>Michael went out on his errand, but just outside
the door came near stepping upon the prostrate form
of the little match boy.</p>

<p>"Get up here!" he said, roughly, supposing at
first that Mark had thrown himself down out of
laziness and gone to sleep.</p>

<p>Mark didn't answer, and Micky, bending over,
saw his fixed expression and waxen pallor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe the little chap's dead," he thought,
startled, and, without more ado, took him up in his
strong arms and carried him into the counting-room.</p>

<p>"Who have you got there, Michael?" asked Richard
Hunter, turning round in surprise.</p>

<p>"A little match boy that was lyin' just outside
the door. He looks as if he might be dead."</p>

<p>Richard jumped at once from his stool, and, approaching
the boy, looked earnestly in his face.</p>

<p>"He has fainted away," he said, after a pause.
"Bring some water, quick!"</p>

<p>Micky brought a glass of water, which was thrown
in the face of Mark. The match boy gave a little
shiver, and, opening his eyes, fixed them upon Richard
Hunter.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he asked, vacantly.</p>

<p>"You are with friends," said Richard, gently.
"You were found at our door faint. Do you feel
sick?"</p>

<p>"I feel weak," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Have you been well lately?"</p>

<p>"No, I've felt tired and weak."</p>

<p>"Are you a match boy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you parents living?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said Richard. "I know how
to pity you. I have no parents either."</p>

<p>"But you have got money," said Mark. "You
don't have to live in the street."</p>

<p>"I was once a street boy like you."</p>

<p>"You!" repeated the match boy, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. But where do you sleep?"</p>

<p>"At the Lodging House."</p>

<p>"It is a good place. Michael, you had better go
to the post-office now."</p>

<p>Mark looked about him a little anxiously.</p>

<p>"Where are my matches?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just outside; I'll get them," said Michael,
promptly.</p>

<p>He brought them in, and then departed on his
errand.</p>

<p>"I guess I'd better be going," said Mark, rising
feebly.</p>

<p>"No," said Richard. "You are not able. Come
here and sit down. You will feel stronger by and
by. Did you eat any breakfast this morning?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little," said Mark, "but I was not very hungry."</p>

<p>"Do you think you could eat anything now?"
Mark shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I don't feel hungry. I only
feel tired."</p>

<p>"Would you like to rest?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That's all I want."</p>

<p>"Come here then, and I will see what I can do
for you."</p>

<p>Mark followed his new friend into the warehouse,
where Richard found a soft bale of cotton, and told
Mark he might lie down upon it. This the poor boy
was glad enough to do. In his weakness he was disposed
to sleep, and soon closed his eyes in slumber.
Several times Richard went out to look at him, but
found him dozing, and was unwilling to interrupt
him.</p>

<p>The day wore away, and afternoon came.</p>

<p>Mark got up from his cotton bale, and with
unsteady steps came to the door of the counting-room.</p>

<p>"I'm going," he said.</p>

<p>Richard turned round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to the Lodge. I think I won't sell
any more matches to-day."</p>

<p>"I'll take all you've left," said Richard. "Don't
trouble yourself about them. But you are not going
to the Lodge."</p>

<p>Mark looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"I shall take you home with me to-night," he
said. "You are not well, and I will look after you.
At the Lodge there will be a crowd of boys, and the
noise will do you harm."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said Mark; "but I'm afraid
I'll trouble you."</p>

<p>"No," said Richard, "I shan't count it a trouble.
I was once a poor boy like you, and I found friends.
I'll be your friend. Go back and lie down again,
and in about an hour I shall be ready to take you
with me."</p>

<p>It seemed strange to Mark to think that there was
somebody who proposed to protect and look after him.
In many of the offices which he visited he met with
rough treatment, and was ordered out of the way, as
if he were a dog, and without human feelings. Many
who treated him in this way were really kind-hearted

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>

men who had at home children whom they loved, but
they appeared to forget that these neglected children
of the street had feelings and wants as well as their
own, who were tenderly nurtured. They did not remember
that they were somebody's children, and
that cold, and harshness, and want were as hard for
them to bear as for those in a higher rank of life.
But Mark was in that state of weakness when it
seemed sweet to throw off all care or thought for the
future, and to sink back upon the soft bale with the
thought that he had nothing to do but to rest.</p>

<p>"That boy is going to be sick," thought Richard
Hunter to himself. "I think he is going to have a
fever."</p>

<p>It was because of this thought that he decided to
carry him home. He had a kind heart, and he knew
how terrible a thing sickness is to these little street
waifs, who have no mother or sister to smooth their
pillows, or cheer them with gentle words. The
friendless condition of the little match boy touched
his heart, and he resolved that, as he had the means
of taking care of him, he would do so.</p>

<p>"Michael," he said, at the close of business hours,
"I wish you would call a hack."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"What, to come here?" asked Micky, surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes. I am going to take that little boy home
with me. I think he is going to be sick, and I am
afraid he would have a hard time of it if I sent him
back into the street."</p>

<p>"Bully for you, Mr. Hunter!" said Micky, who,
though rough in his outward manners, was yet capable
of appreciating kindness in others. There were
times indeed in the past when he had treated smaller
boys brutally, but it was under the influence of passion.
He had improved greatly since, and his better
nature was beginning to show itself.</p>

<p>Micky went out, and soon returned in state inside
a hack. He was leaning back, thinking it would be
a very good thing if he had a carriage of his own to
ride in. But I am afraid that day will never come.
Micky has already turned out much better than was
expected, but he is hardly likely to rise much higher
than the subordinate position he now occupies. In
capacity and education he is far inferior to his old
associate, Richard Hunter, who is destined to rise
much higher than at present.</p>

<p>Richard Hunter went to the rear of the warehouse
where Mark still lay on his bale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come," he said; "we'll go home now."</p>

<p>Mark rose from his recumbent position, and
walked to the door. He saw with surprise the carriage,
the door of which Micky Maguire held open.</p>

<p>"Are we going to ride in that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Richard Hunter. "Let me help you
in."</p>

<p>The little match boy sank back in the soft seat in
vague surprise at his good luck. He could not help
wondering what Ben Gibson would say if he could
see him now.</p>

<p>Richard Hunter sat beside him, and supported
Mark's head. The driver whipped up his horse, and
they were speedily on their way up the Bowery to
St. Mark's Place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">RICHARD HUNTER'S WARD.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">It</span></span>
was about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon
when the carriage containing Richard Hunter and
the match boy stopped in front of his boarding-place
in St. Mark's Place. Richard helped the
little boy out, saying, cheerfully, "Well, we've got
home."</p>

<p>"Is this where you live?" asked Mark, faintly.</p>

<p>"Yes. How do you like it?"</p>

<p>"It's a nice place. I am afraid you are taking
too much trouble about me."</p>

<p>"Don't think of that. Come in."</p>

<p>Richard had ascended the front steps, after paying
the hackman, and taking out his night-key opened
the outside door.</p>

<p>"Come upstairs," he said.</p>

<p>They ascended two flights of stairs, and Richard
threw open the door of his room. A fire was already

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>

burning in the grate, and it looked bright and cheerful.</p>

<p>"Do you feel tired?" asked Richard.</p>

<p>"Yes, a little."</p>

<p>"Then lie right down on the bed. You are hungry
too,&mdash;are you not?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"I will have something sent up to you."</p>

<p>Just then Fosdick, who, it will be remembered,
was Richard Hunter's room-mate, entered the room.
He looked with surprise at Mark, and then inquiringly
at Richard.</p>

<p>"It is a little match boy," explained the latter,
"who fell in a fainting-fit in front of our office. I
think the poor fellow is going to be sick, so I
brought him home, and mean to take care of him till
he is well."</p>

<p>"You must let me share the expense, Dick," said
Fosdick.</p>

<p>"No, but I'll let you share the care of him.
That will do just as well."</p>

<p>"But I would rather share the expense. He reminds
me of the way I was situated when I fell in
with you. What is your name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mark Manton," said the match boy.</p>

<p>"I've certainly seen him somewhere before," said
Fosdick, reflectively. "His face looks familiar to
me."</p>

<p>"So it does to me. Perhaps I've seen him about
the streets somewhere."</p>

<p>"I have it," said Fosdick, suddenly; "don't you
remember the boy we saw sleeping in the cabin of
the Fulton Ferry-boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I think he is the one. Mark," he continued,
turning to the match boy, "didn't you sleep one
night on a Brooklyn ferry-boat about three months
ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark.</p>

<p>"And did you find anything in your vest-pocket
in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the match boy with interest. "I
found a dollar, and didn't know where it came from.
Was it you that put it in?"</p>

<p>"He had a hand in it," said Fosdick, pointing
with a smile to his room-mate.</p>

<p>"I was very glad to get it," said Mark. "I
only had eight cents besides, and that gave me

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>

enough to buy some matches. That was at the time
I ran away."</p>

<p>"Who did you run away from?"</p>

<p>"From Mother Watson."</p>

<p>"Mother Watson?" repeated Dick. "I wonder
if I don't know her. She is a very handsome old
lady, with a fine red complexion, particularly about
the nose."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark, with a smile.</p>

<p>"And she takes whiskey when she can get it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How did you fall in with her?"</p>

<p>"She promised to take care of me when my mother
died, but instead of that she wanted me to earn
money for her."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was always a very disinterested old
lady. So it appears you didn't like her as a guardian?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then suppose you take me. Would you like to
be my ward?"</p>

<p>"I think I would, but I don't know what it
means," said Mark.</p>

<p>"It means that I'm to look after you," said Dick,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>

"just as if I was your uncle or grandfather. You
may call me grandfather if you want to."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're too young," said Mark, amused in
spite of his weakness.</p>

<p>"Then we won't decide just at present about the
name. But I forgot all about your being hungry."</p>

<p>"I'm not very hungry."</p>

<p>"At any rate you haven't had anything to eat
since morning, and need something. I'll go down
and see Mrs. Wilson about it."</p>

<p>Richard Hunter soon explained matters to Mrs.
Wilson, to whom he offered to pay an extra weekly
sum for Mark, and arranged that a small single bed
should be placed in one corner of the room temporarily
in which the match boy should sleep. He
speedily reappeared with a bowl of broth, a cup
of tea, and some dry toast. The sight of these caused
the match boy's eyes to brighten, and he was able
to do very good justice to all.</p>

<p>"Now," said Richard Hunter, "I will call in a
doctor, and find out what is the matter with my
little ward."</p>

<p>In the course of the evening Dr. Pemberton, a
young dispensary physician, whose acquaintance

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>

Richard had casually made, called at his request and
looked at the patient.</p>

<p>"He is not seriously sick," he pronounced. "It
is chiefly debility that troubles him, brought on
probably by exposure, and over-exertion in this languid
spring weather."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think he is going to have a
fever?" said Dick.</p>

<p>"No, not if he remains under your care. Had
he continued in the street, I think he would not have
escaped one."</p>

<p>"What shall we do for him?"</p>

<p>"Rest is most important of all. That, with nourishing
food and freedom from exposure, will soon
bring him round again."</p>

<p>"He shall have all these."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know him, as you take so much
interest in him?"</p>

<p>"No, I never saw him but once before to-day, but
I am able to befriend him, and he has no other
friends."</p>

<p>"There are not many young men who would take
all this trouble about a poor match boy," said the
doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's because they don't know how hard it is to
be friendless and neglected," said Dick. "I've
known that feeling, and it makes me pity those who
are in the same condition I once was."</p>

<p>"I wish there were more like you, Mr. Hunter,"
said Dr. Pemberton. "There would be less suffering
in the world. As to our little patient here, I
have no doubt he will do well, and soon be on his
legs again."</p>

<p>Indeed Mark was already looking better and feeling
better. The rest which he had obtained during
the day, and the refreshment he had just taken, were
precisely what he needed. He soon fell asleep, and
Richard and Fosdick, lighting the gas lamp on the
centre-table, sat down to their evening studies.</p>

<p>In a few days Mark was decidedly better, but it
was thought best that he should still keep the room.
He liked it very well in the evening when Dick and
Fosdick were at home, but he felt rather lonesome
in the daytime. Richard Hunter thought of this
one day, and said, "Can you read, Mark?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the match boy.</p>

<p>"Who taught you? Not Mother Watson,
surely."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, she couldn't read herself. It was my
mother who taught me."</p>

<p>"I think I must get you two or three books of
stories to read while we are away in the daytime."</p>

<p>"You are spending too much money for me, Mr
Hunter."</p>

<p>"Remember I am your guardian, and it is my
duty to take care of you."</p>

<p>The next morning on his way down town, Richard
Hunter stepped into a retail bookstore on Broadway.
As he entered, a boy, if indeed it be allowable to
apply such a term to a personage so consequential in
his manners, came forward.</p>

<p>"What, Roswell Crawford, are you here?" asked
Richard Hunter, in surprise.</p>

<p>Roswell, who has already been mentioned in this
story, and who figured considerably in previous volumes
of this series, answered rather stiffly to this
salutation.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I am here for a short time.
I came in to oblige Mr. Baker."</p>

<p>"You were always very obliging, Roswell," said
Richard, good-humoredly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Roswell did not appear to appreciate this compliment.
He probably thought it savored of irony.</p>

<p>"Do you want to buy anything this morning?" he
said, shortly.</p>

<p>"Yes; I would like to look at some books of fairy
stories."</p>

<p>"For your own reading, I suppose," said Roswell.</p>

<p>"I may read them, but I am getting them for my
ward."</p>

<p>"Is he a boot-black?" sneered Roswell, who knew
all about Dick's early career.</p>

<p>"No," said Richard, "he's a match boy; so if
you've got any books that you can warrant to be
just the thing for match boys, I should like to see
them."</p>

<p>"We don't have many customers of that class,"
said Roswell, unpleasantly. "They generally go
to cheaper establishments, when they are able to
read."</p>

<p>"Do they?" said Dick. "I'm glad you've got
into a place where you only meet the cream of society,"
and Dick glanced significantly at a red-nosed
man who came in to buy a couple of sheets of notepaper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Roswell colored.</p>

<p>"There are some exceptions," he said, and glanced
pointedly at Richard Hunter himself.</p>

<p>"Well," said Dick, after looking over a collection
of juvenile books, "I'll take these two."</p>

<p>He drew out his pocket-book, and handed Roswell
a ten-dollar bill. Roswell changed it with a feeling
of jealousy and envy. He was the "son of a gentleman,"
as he often boasted, but he never had a ten-dollar
bill in his pocket. Indeed, he was now working
for six dollars a week, and glad to get that, after
having been out of a situation for several months.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Gladden, of the large down-town
firm of Gladden &amp; Co., came into the store, and, seeing
Richard, saluted him cordially.</p>

<p>"How are you this morning, Mr. Hunter?" he
said. "Are you on your way down town?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Richard.</p>

<p>"Come with me. We will take an omnibus together;"
and the two walked out of the store in
familiar conversation.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think such a man as Mr. Gladden
would notice a low boot-black," said Roswell, bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The rest of the day he was made unhappy by the
thought of Dick's prosperity, and his own hard fate,
in being merely a clerk in a bookstore with a salary
of six dollars a week.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">MARK GETS A PLACE.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">In</span></span>
a week from the purchase of the books, Mark
felt that he was fully recovered. He never had
much color, but the unhealthy pallor had left his
cheeks, and he had an excellent appetite.</p>

<p>"Well, Mark, how do you feel to-night?" asked
Richard, on his return from the store one evening.</p>

<p>"I'm all right, now, Mr. Hunter. I think I will
go to work to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"What sort of work?"</p>

<p>"Selling matches."</p>

<p>"Do you like to sell matches?"</p>

<p>"I like it better than selling papers, or blacking
boots."</p>

<p>"But wouldn't you like better to be in a store?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't get a place," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"My clothes are ragged," said the match boy with

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>

some hesitation. "Besides I haven't got anybody
to refer to."</p>

<p>"Can't you refer to your guardian?" asked Richard
Hunter, smiling.</p>

<p>"Do you think I had better try to get a place in
a store, Mr. Hunter?" asked Mark.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it would be much better for you
than to sell matches on the street. You are not a
strong boy, and the exposure is not good for you.
As to your clothes, we'll see if we cannot supply you
with something better than you have on."</p>

<p>"But," said Mark, "I want to pay for my clothes
myself. I have got ten dollars in the bank at the
Newsboys' Lodge."</p>

<p>"Very well. You can go down to-morrow morning
and get it. But we needn't wait for that. I
will go and get you some clothes before I go to business."</p>

<p>In the morning Richard Hunter went out with
the match boy, and for twenty dollars obtained
for him a very neat gray suit, besides a supply of
under-clothing. Mark put them on at once, and felt
not a little pleased with the improvement in his appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can carry your old clothes to Mr. O'Connor,"
said Richard. "They are not very good, but
they are better than none, and he may have an opportunity
of giving them away."</p>

<p>"You have been very kind to me, Mr. Hunter,"
said Mark, gratefully. "Good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by? What makes you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because I am going now to the Newsboys'
Lodge."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you are coming back again."</p>

<p>"But I think I had better go there to live now.
It will be much cheaper, and I ought not to put you
to so much expense."</p>

<p>"You're a good boy, Mark, but you must remember
that I am your guardian, and am to be obeyed as
such. You're not going back to the Lodge to live.
I have arranged to have you stay with me at my
boarding-place. As soon as you have got a place you
will work in the daytime, and every Saturday night
you will bring me your money. In the evening I
shall have you study a little, for I don't want you to
grow up as ignorant as I was at your age."</p>

<p>"Were you ignorant, Mr. Hunter?" asked Mark,
with interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I was," said Richard. "When I was fourteen,
I couldn't read nor write."</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe that, Mr. Hunter," said
Mark. "You're such a fine scholar."</p>

<p>"Am I?" asked Richard, smiling, yet well pleased
with the compliment.</p>

<p>"Why, you can read French as fast as I can read
English, and write beautifully."</p>

<p>"Well, I had to work hard to do it," said Richard
Hunter. "But I feel paid for all the time I've
spent in trying to improve myself. Sometimes I've
thought I should like to spend the evening at some
place of amusement rather than in study; but if I
had, there'd be nothing to show for it now. Take
my advice, Mark, and study all you can, and you'll
grow up respectable and respected."</p>

<p>"Now," he added, after a pause, "I'll tell you
what you may do. You may look in my 'Herald'
every morning, and whenever you see a boy advertised
for you can call, or whenever, in going along the
street, you see a notice 'Boy wanted,' you may call in,
and sooner or later you'll get something. If they
ask for references, you may refer to Richard Hunter,
book-keeper for Rockwell &amp; Cooper."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Hunter," said Mark. "I will
do so."</p>

<p>On parting with his guardian the match boy went
down town to the Lodging House. The superintendent
received him kindly.</p>

<p>"I didn't know what had become of you, Mark,"
he said. "If it had been some of the boys, I should
have been afraid they had got into a scrape, and gone
to the Island. But I didn't think that of you."</p>

<p>"I hope you'll never hear that of me, Mr. O'Connor,"
said Mark.</p>

<p>"I hope not. I'm always sorry to hear of any
boy's going astray. But you seem to have been
doing well since I saw you;" and the superintendent
glanced at Mark's new clothes.</p>

<p>"I've met with some kind friends," said the match
boy. "I have been sick, and they took care of
me."</p>

<p>"And now you have come back to the Lodge."</p>

<p>"Yes, but not to stay. I came for the money
that I have saved up in the bank. It is going for
these clothes."</p>

<p>"Very well. You shall have it. What is the
name of the friend who has taken care of you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Richard Hunter."</p>

<p>"I know him," said the superintendent. "He is
an excellent young man. You could not be in better
hands."</p>

<p>On leaving the Lodge Mark felt a desire to find
his old ally, Ben Gibson, who, though rather a rough
character, had been kind to him.</p>

<p>Ben was not difficult to find. During business
hours he was generally posted on Nassau Street,
somewhere between Fulton Street and Spruce
Street.</p>

<p>He was just polishing off a customer's boots when
Mark came up, and touched him lightly on the
shoulder. Ben looked up, but did not at first recognize
the match boy in the neatly dressed figure
before him.</p>

<p>"Shine yer boots!" he asked, in a professional
tone.</p>

<p>"Why, Ben, don't you know me?" asked Mark,
laughing.</p>

<p>"My eyes, if it aint Mark, the match boy!" exclaimed
Ben, in surprise. "Where've you been all
this while, Mark?"</p>

<p>"I've been sick, Ben."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to be sick too, if that's the way you got
them clo'es. I didn't know what had 'come of you."</p>

<p>"I found some good friends," said Mark.</p>

<p>"If your friends have got any more good clo'es
they want to get rid of," said Ben, "tell 'em you
know a chap that can take care of a few. Are you
in the match business now?"</p>

<p>"I haven't been doing anything for three weeks,"
said Mark.</p>

<p>"Goin' to sell matches again?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Sellin' papers?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm trying to find a place in a store."</p>

<p>"I don't think I'd like to be in a store," said Ben,
reflectively. "I'm afraid my delicate constitution
couldn't stand the confinement. Besides, I'm my
own boss now, and don't have nobody to order me
round."</p>

<p>"But you don't expect to black boots all your life,
Ben, do you?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Ben. "Maybe when I'm married,
I'll choose some other business. It would be
rather hard to support a family at five cents a shine.
Are you comin' to the Lodge to-night?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Mark, "I'm boarding up at St. Mark's
Place."</p>

<p>"Mother Watson hasn't opened a fashionable
boardin'-house up there, has she?"</p>

<p>"I guess not," said Mark, smiling. "I can't think
what has become of her. I haven't seen her since
the day she tried to carry me off."</p>

<p>"I've heard of her," said Ben. "She's stoppin'
with some friends at the Island. They won't let her
come away on account of likin' her company so
much."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall never see her again," said Mark,
with a shudder. "She is a wicked old woman. But
I must be going, Ben."</p>

<p>"I s'pose you'll come and see a feller now and
then."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ben, when I get time. But I hope to get
a place soon."</p>

<p>Mark walked leisurely up Broadway. Having
been confined to the house for three weeks, he enjoyed
the excitement of being out in the street once
more. The shop windows looked brighter and gayer
than before, and the little match boy felt that the
world was a very pleasant place after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>He had passed Eighth Street before he was fairly
aware of the distance he had traversed. He found
himself looking into the window of a bookstore.
While examining the articles in the window his eye
suddenly caught the notice pasted in the middle of
the glass on a piece of white paper:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"BOY WANTED."<br />
</p>

<p>"Perhaps they'll take me," thought Mark, suddenly.
"At any rate I'll go in and see."</p>

<p>Accordingly he entered the store, and looked about
him a little undecidedly.</p>

<p>"Well, sonny, what do you want?" asked a clerk.</p>

<p>"I see that you want a boy," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you want a place?"</p>

<p>"I am trying to get one."</p>

<p>"Well, go and see that gentleman about it."</p>

<p>He pointed to a gentleman who was seated at a
desk in the corner of the store.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, do you want a boy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the gentleman. "How old are
you?"</p>

<p>"Ten years old."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are rather young. Have you been in any
place before?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you know your way about the city pretty
well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I want a boy to deliver papers and magazines,
and carry small parcels of books. Do you think you
could do that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Without stopping to play on the way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I have just discharged one boy, because he was
gone an hour and a half on an errand to Twentieth
Street. You are the first boy that has answered
my advertisement. I'll try you on a salary of three
dollars a week, if you can go to work at once.
What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Mark Manton."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mark. Go to Mr. Jones, behind
the counter there, and he will give you a parcel to
carry to West Twenty-First Street."</p>

<p>"I'm in luck," thought Mark. "I didn't expect
to get a place so easily."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">MARK'S FIRST IMPRESSIONS.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">Probably</span></span>
my readers already understand that
the bookstore in which Mark has secured a place is
the same in which Roswell Crawford is employed. This
circumstance, if Mark had only known it, was likely
to make his position considerably less desirable than
it would otherwise have been. Mr. Baker, the proprietor
of the store, was very considerate in his treatment
of those in his employ, and Mr. Jones, his chief clerk,
was good-natured and pleasant. But Roswell was
very apt to be insolent and disagreeable to those
who were, or whom he considered to be, in an inferior
position to himself, while his lofty ideas of his
own dignity and social position as the "son of a
gentleman," made him not very desirable as a clerk.
Still he had learned something from his bad luck
thus far. He had been so long in getting his present
place, that he felt it prudent to sacrifice his pride

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>

in some extent for the sake of retaining it. But if
he could neglect his duties without attracting attention,
he resolved to do it, feeling that six dollars was
a beggarly salary for a young gentleman of his
position and capacity. It was unfortunate for him,
and a source of considerable annoyance, that he
could get no one except his mother to assent to his
own estimate of his abilities. Even his Cousin
Gilbert, who had been Rockwell &amp; Cooper's book-keeper
before Richard Hunter succeeded to the position,
did not conceal his poor opinion of Roswell;
but this the latter attributed to prejudice, being
persuaded in his own mind that his cousin was
somewhat inclined to be envious of his superior
abilities.</p>

<p>At the time that Mark was so suddenly engaged
by Mr. Baker, Roswell had gone out to dinner.
When he returned, Mark had gone out with the
parcel to West Twenty-first Street. So they missed
each other just at first.</p>

<p>"Well, Crawford," said Mr. Jones, as Roswell
re-entered the store, "Mr. Baker has engaged a new
boy."</p>

<p>"Has he? What sort of a fellow is he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little fellow. He doesn't look as if he was
more than ten years old."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Baker sent him on an errand to Twenty-first
Street."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Roswell, a little discontented,
"I was going to recommend a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"There may be a chance yet. This boy may not
suit."</p>

<p>In about five minutes Mr. Baker and Mr. Jones
both went out to dinner. It was the middle of the
day, when there is very little business, and it would
not be difficult for Roswell to attend to any customers
who might call.</p>

<p>As soon as he was left alone, Roswell got an interesting
book from the shelves, and, sitting down
in his employer's chair, began to read, though this
was against the rules in business hours. To see the
pompous air with which Roswell threw himself back
in his chair, it might have been supposed that he
was the proprietor of the establishment, though I
believe it is true, as a general rule, that employers
are not in the habit of putting on so many airs, unless
the position is a new one, and they have not yet

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>

got over the new feeling of importance which it is
apt to inspire at first.</p>

<p>While Roswell was thus engaged Mark returned
from his errand.</p>

<p>He looked about him in some uncertainty on
entering the store, not seeing either Mr. Baker or
the chief clerk.</p>

<p>"Come here," said Roswell, in a tone of authority.</p>

<p>Mark walked up to the desk.</p>

<p>"So you are the new boy?" said Roswell,
after a close scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It would be a little more polite to say 'Yes
sir.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What is your age?"</p>

<p>"Ten years."</p>

<p>"Humph! You are rather young. If I had
been consulted I should have said 'Get a boy of
twelve years old.'"</p>

<p>"I hope I shall suit," said Mark.</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Roswell, patronizingly. "You
will find us very easy to get along with if you do

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>

your duty. We were obliged to send away a boy
this morning because he played instead of going on
his errands at once."</p>

<p>Mark could not help wondering what was Roswell's
position in the establishment. He talked as
if he were one of the proprietors; but his youthful
appearance made it difficult to suppose that.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" continued Roswell.</p>

<p>"Mark Manton."</p>

<p>"Have you been in any place before?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you live with your parents?"</p>

<p>"My parents are dead."</p>

<p>"Then whom do you live with?"</p>

<p>"With my guardian."</p>

<p>"So you have a guardian?" said Roswell, a little
surprised. "What is his name?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunter."</p>

<p>"Hunter!" repeated Roswell, hastily. "What
is his first name?"</p>

<p>"Richard I believe."</p>

<p>"Dick Hunter!" exclaimed Roswell, scornfully,
"Do you mean to say that he has charge of
you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark, firmly, for he perceived the
tone in which his friend was referred to, and resented
it. Moreover the new expression which came
over Roswell's face brought back to his recollection
the evening when, for the first time in his life, he
had begged in Fulton Market, and been scornfully
repulsed by Roswell and his mother. Roswell's face
had at first seemed familiar to him, but it was only
now that he recognized him. Roswell, on the other
hand, was not likely to identify the neatly dressed
boy before him with the shivering little beggar of
the market. But it recurred to him all at once
that Dick had referred to his ward as a match
boy.</p>

<p>"You were a match boy?" he said, in the manner
of one making a grave accusation.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you keep on selling matches,
and not try to get a place in a respectable store?"</p>

<p>"Because Mr. Hunter thought it better for me
to go into a store."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunter! Perhaps you don't know that
your guardian, as you call him, used to be a boot-black."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he told me so."</p>

<p>"They called him 'Ragged Dick' then," said
Roswell, turning up his nose. "He couldn't read
or write, I believe."</p>

<p>"He's a good scholar now," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Humph! I suppose he told you so. But you
mustn't believe all he tells you."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't tell anything but the truth," said
Mark, who was bolder in behalf of his friend than he
would have been for himself.</p>

<p>"So he did tell you he was a good scholar? I
thought so."</p>

<p>"No, he told me nothing about it; but since I
have lived with him I've heard him read French as
well as English."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that isn't saying much," said Roswell,
with a sneer. "Can you read yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That is more than I expected. What induced
Mr. Baker to take a boy from the street is more than
I can tell."</p>

<p>"I suppose I can run errands just as well, if I
was once a match boy," said Mark, who did not
fancy the tone which Roswell assumed towards him,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>

and began to doubt whether he was a person of as
much importance as he at first supposed.</p>

<p>"We shall see," said Roswell, loftily. "But
there's one thing I'll advise you, young man, and
that is, to treat me with proper respect. You'll find
it best to keep friends with me. I can get you
turned away any time."</p>

<p>Mark hardly knew whether to believe this or not.
He already began to suspect that Roswell was something
of a humbug, and though it was not in his
nature to form a causeless dislike, he certainly did
not feel disposed to like Roswell. He did not care
as much for any slighting remarks upon himself, as
for the scorn with which Roswell saw fit to speak of
his friend, Richard Hunter, who by his good offices
had won the little boy's lasting gratitude. Mark
did not reply to the threat contained in these last
words of Roswell.</p>

<p>"Is there anything for me to do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may dust off those books on the counter.
There's the duster hanging up."</p>

<p>This was really Roswell's business, and he ought
to have been at work in this way instead of reading;
but it was characteristic of him to shift his duties

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>

upon others. He was not aware of how much time
had passed, and supposed that Mark would be
through before Mr. Barker returned. But that
gentleman came in while Roswell was busily engaged
in reading.</p>

<p>"Is that the way you do your work, Roswell?"
asked his employer.</p>

<p>Roswell jumped to his feet in some confusion.</p>

<p>"I thought I had better set the new boy to work,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Dusting the books is your work, not his."</p>

<p>"He was doing nothing, sir."</p>

<p>"He will have plenty to do in carrying out parcels.
Besides, I don't know that it is any worse for
him to be idle than you. You were reading also,
which you know is against the rules of the store."
Roswell made no reply, but it hurt his pride considerably
to be censured thus in presence of Mark,
to whom he had spoken with such an assumption of
power and patronage.</p>

<p>"I wish I had a store of my own," he thought,
discontentedly. "Then I could do as I pleased
without having anybody to interfere with me."</p>

<p>But Roswell did not understand, and there are

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>

plenty of boys in the same state of ignorance, that
those who fill subordinate positions acceptably are
most likely to rise to stations where they will themselves
have control over others.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have not been to dinner," said
Mr. Baker, turning to Mark.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You board in St. Mark's Place, I think you
said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well, here is a parcel to go to East Ninth
Street. You may call and leave that at the address
marked upon it, and may stay out long enough for
dinner. But don't be gone more than an hour in
all."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"I am glad that boy isn't my employer," thought
Mark, referring of course to Roswell Crawford, who,
by the way, would have been indignant at such
an appellation. "I like Mr. Baker a great deal
better."</p>

<p>Mark was punctual to his appointment, and in a
little less than an hour reported himself at the store
again for duty.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">BAD ADVICE.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">Roswell</span></span>
pursued his way home with a general
sense of discontent. Why should he be so much
worse off than Richard Hunter, who had only been
a ragged boot-black three years before? The whole
world seemed to be in a conspiracy to advance
Richard, and to keep him down. To think he
should be only earning six dollars a week, while
Dick, whom he considered so far beneath him, was
receiving twenty, was really outrageous. And now
he had pushed a low dependent of his into Baker's
store where Roswell was obliged to associate with
him!</p>

<p>Certainly Roswell's grievances were numerous.
But there was one thing he did not understand, that
the greatest obstacle to his advancement was himself.
If he had entered any situation with the determination
to make his services valuable, and discharge

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>

his duties, whatever they might be, with conscientious
fidelity, he would have found his relations with
his employer much more agreeable and satisfactory.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crawford still kept the house in Clinton
Place, letting nearly all the rooms to lodgers. In
this way she succeeded in making both ends meet,
though with considerable difficulty, so that she had
not the means to supply Roswell with the spending
money he desired. Her nephew, James Gilbert,
Richard Huntley's predecessor as book-keeper, still
boarded with her. It will be remembered by the
readers of "Fame and Fortune," that this Gilbert,
on being questioned by Mr. Rockwell as to his share
in the plot against Dick, had angrily resigned his
position, thinking, probably, that he should lose it at
any rate.</p>

<p>It so happened that business was generally depressed
at this time, and it was three months before
he succeeded in obtaining another place, and then
he was compelled to work for eight hundred dollars,
or two hundred less than he had formerly received.
This was a great disappointment to him, and did not
help his temper much, which had never been very
sweet. He felt quite exasperated against Dick,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>

whom, very much against his wishes, he had seen
the means of promoting to his own place. Indeed,
on this point, he sympathized heartily with Roswell,
whose dislike to Richard Hunter has already been
shown.</p>

<p>"Well, mother," said Roswell, as he entered
Mrs. Crawford's presence, "I'm getting tired of
Baker's store."</p>

<p>"Don't say so, Roswell," said his mother, in
alarm. "Remember how long it took you to get
the place."</p>

<p>"I have to work like a dog for six dollars a
week," said Roswell.</p>

<p>"Yes," said his cousin, with a sneer, "that's
precisely the way you work. Dogs spend their
time running round the street doing nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, I have to work hard enough," said
Roswell, "but I wouldn't mind that so much, if I
didn't have to associate with low match boys."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Roswell?" asked his
mother, who did not understand the allusion.</p>

<p>"Baker hired a new boy to-day, and who do you
think he turns out to be?"</p>

<p>"Not that boy, Ragged Dick?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, you don't think he would give up Cousin
James' place, where he gets a thousand dollars a
year, to go into Baker's as boy?"</p>

<p>"Who was it, then?"</p>

<p>"He used to be a ragged match boy about the
streets. Dick Hunter picked him up somewhere,
and got him a situation in our store, on purpose to
spite me, I expect."</p>

<p>As the reader is aware, Roswell was mistaken in
his supposition, as Mark obtained the place on his
own responsibility.</p>

<p>"The boot-black seems to be putting on airs," said
Mrs. Crawford.</p>

<p>"Yes, he pretends to be the guardian of this
match boy."</p>

<p>"What's the boy's name?"</p>

<p>"Mark Manton."</p>

<p>"If I were Mr. Baker," said Mrs. Crawford, "I
should be afraid to take a street boy into my employ.
Very likely he isn't honest."</p>

<p>"I wish he would steal something," said Roswell,
not very charitably. "Then we could get rid of
him, and the boot-black would be pretty well mortified
about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"He'll be found out sooner or later," said Mrs.
Crawford. "You may depend on that. You'd
better keep a sharp lookout for him, Roswell. If
you catch him in stealing, it will help you with Mr.
Baker, or ought to."</p>

<p>This would have comforted Roswell more, but that
he was privately of opinion that Mark was honest,
and would not be likely to give him any chance of
detecting him in stealing. Still, by a little management
on his part, he might cause him to fall under
suspicion. It would of course be miserably mean on
his part to implicate a little boy in a false charge;
but Roswell <em>was</em> a mean boy, and he was not scrupulous
where his dislike was concerned. He privately
decided to think over this new plan for getting Mark
into trouble.</p>

<p>"Isn't dinner ready, mother?" he asked, rather
impatiently.</p>

<p>"It will be in about ten minutes."</p>

<p>"I'm as hungry as a bear."</p>

<p>"You can always do your part at the table," said
his cousin unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I shouldn't. I have to work
hard enough."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are always talking about your hard work.
My belief is that you don't earn your wages."</p>

<p>"I should think it was a pity if I didn't earn six
dollars a week," said Roswell.</p>

<p>"Come, James, you're always hard on Roswell,"
said Mrs. Crawford. "I am sure he has hard times
enough without his own relations turning against
him."</p>

<p>James Gilbert did not reply. He was naturally
of a sarcastic turn, and, seeing Roswell's faults, was
not inclined to spare them. He might have pointed
them out, however, in a kindly manner, and then his
young cousin might possibly been benefited; but
Gilbert felt very little interest in Roswell.</p>

<p>Immediately after dinner Roswell took up his cap.
His mother observed this, and inquired, "Where
are you going, Roswell?"</p>

<p>"I'm going out to walk."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go with your cousin?"</p>

<p>James Gilbert had also taken his hat.</p>

<p>"He don't want to be bothered with me," said
Roswell, and this statement Gilbert did not take the
trouble to contradict.</p>

<p>"Why can't you stay in and read?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't got anything to read. Besides I've
been cooped up in the store all day, and I want to
breathe a little fresh air."</p>

<p>There was reason in this, and his mother did not
gainsay it, but still she felt that it was not quite safe
for a boy to spend his evenings out in a large city,
without any one to look after him.</p>

<p>Roswell crossed Broadway, and, proceeding down
Eighth Street, met a boy of about his own age in
front of the Cooper Institute.</p>

<p>"How long have you been waiting, Ralph?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Not long. I only just came up."</p>

<p>"I couldn't get away as soon as I expected. Dinner
was rather late."</p>

<p>"Have a cigar, Roswell?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Roswell, "I don't mind."</p>

<p>"You'll find these cigars pretty good. I paid ten
cents apiece."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can afford it," said Roswell.
"Your cigars must cost you considerable."</p>

<p>"I don't always buy ten-centers. Generally I
pay only five cents."</p>

<p>"Well, that mounts up when you smoke three or

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>

four in a day. Let me see, what wages do you
get?"</p>

<p>"Seven dollars a week."</p>

<p>"That's only a dollar more than I get," said
Roswell.</p>

<p>"I know one thing, it's miserably small," said
Ralph. "We ought to get twice what we do."</p>

<p>"These shop-keepers are awfully mean," said
Roswell, beginning to puff away at his cigar.</p>

<p>"That's so."</p>

<p>"But still you always seem to have plenty of
money. That's what puzzles me," said Roswell.
"I'm always pinched. I have to pay my mother
all my wages but a dollar a week. And what's a
dollar?" he repeated, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Well," said Ralph, "my board costs me all but
a dollar. So we are about even there."</p>

<p>"Do you pay your board out of your earnings?"</p>

<p>"I have to. My governor won't foot the bills, so
I have to."</p>

<p>"Still you seem to have plenty of money," persisted
Roswell.</p>

<p>"Yes, I look out for that," said Ralph Graham,
significantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I don't see how you manage. I might look
out all day, and I wouldn't be any the better off."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't go the right way to work,"
said his companion, taking the cigar from his mouth,
and knocking off the ashes.</p>

<p>"Then I wish you'd tell me the right way."</p>

<p>"Why, the fact is," said Ralph, slowly, "I make
my employer pay me higher wages than he thinks
he does."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can do that," said Roswell,
who didn't yet understand.</p>

<p>Ralph took the cigar, now nearly smoked out,
from his mouth, and threw it on the pavement. He
bent towards Roswell, and whispered something in
his ear. Roswell started and turned pale.</p>

<p>"But," he said, "that's dishonest."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Ralph, "don't speak so loud.
Oughtn't employers to pay fair wages,&mdash;tell me
that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"But if they don't and won't, what then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, I do. We must help ourselves, that is
all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," said Roswell, "what would be thought
of you if it were found out?"</p>

<p>"There's plenty of clerks that do it. Bless you,
it's expected. I heard a man say once that he expected
to lose about so much by his clerks."</p>

<p>"But I think it would be better to pay good
wages."</p>

<p>"So do I, only you see they won't do it."</p>

<p>"How much do you&mdash;do you make outside of
your salary?" asked Roswell.</p>

<p>"From three to five dollars a week."</p>

<p>"I should think they'd find you out."</p>

<p>"I don't let them. I'm pretty careful. Well,
what shall we do this evening? There's a pretty
good play at Niblo's. Suppose we go there."</p>

<p>"I haven't got money enough," said Roswell.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll pay for both to-night. You can pay
another time."</p>

<p>"All right!" said Roswell, though he did not
know when he should have money enough to return
the favor. They crossed to Broadway, and walked
leisurely to Niblo's Garden. The performance lasted
till late, and it was after eleven when Roswell
Crawford got into bed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE FIRST STEP.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">To</span></span>
do Roswell Crawford justice, the idea of taking
money from his employer had never occurred to him
until the day when it was suggested to him by Ralph
Graham. The suggestion came to him at an unfortunate
time. He had always felt with a sense of
bitter injustice that his services were poorly compensated,
and that his employer was making money out
of him. Yet he knew very well that there was no
chance of an advance. Besides, he really felt the
need of more money to keep up appearances equal to
Ralph Graham, and some other not very creditable
acquaintances that he had managed to pick up. So
Roswell allowed Ralph's suggestion to recur to his
mind with dangerous frequency. He was getting
familiar with what had at first startled and shocked
him.</p>

<p>But it was not at once that he brought his mind

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>

to the point. He was not possessed of much courage,
and could not help fearing that he would get himself
into a scrape. It needed a little more urging on the
part of Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, Roswell," said Ralph, a few evenings after
the conversation recorded in the last chapter, "when
are you going to take me to the theatre?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know I was going to take you at all,"
said Roswell.</p>

<p>"Come, there's no use in crawling off that way.
Didn't I take you to Niblo's last week?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And didn't you promise to take me some night
in return?"</p>

<p>"I should like to do it well enough," said Roswell,
"but I never have any money."</p>

<p>"You might have some if you chose."</p>

<p>"The way you mentioned?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't like to try it."</p>

<p>"Then you are foolish. It's what half the clerks
do. They have to."</p>

<p>"Do you think many do it?" said Roswell, irresolutely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure they do," said Ralph, confidently.</p>

<p>"But I am sure it would be found out."</p>

<p>"Not if you're careful."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't know how to go about it."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you. You're in the store alone
some of the time, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, when Mr. Baker and Mr. Jones are gone to
dinner."</p>

<p>"Where is the money kept?"</p>

<p>"There are two drawers. The one that has
the most money in it is kept locked, and Mr.
Baker carries away the key with him. He leaves a
few dollars in another drawer, but nothing could be
taken from that drawer without being missed."</p>

<p>"Does he keep much money in the first drawer?"</p>

<p>"I expect so."</p>

<p>"Then," said Ralph, promptly, "you must manage
to get into that."</p>

<p>"But how am I to do it?" asked Roswell.
"Didn't I tell you that it was kept locked, and that
Mr. Baker took the key?"</p>

<p>"I can't say you are very smart. Roswell," said
Ralph, a little contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you mean, then."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is easier than to get a key made that will
fit the drawer? All you'll have to do is to take an
impression of the lock with sealing-wax, and carry it
to a locksmith. He'll make you a key for two shillings."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Roswell, undecidedly. "I
don't quite like to do it."</p>

<p>"Do just as you please," said Ralph; "only if I
carry you to the theatre I expect you to return the
compliment."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll think of it," said Roswell.</p>

<p>"There is another way you can do," suggested
Ralph, who was full of evil suggestions, and was
perhaps the most dangerous counsellor that Roswell
could have had at this time.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"If you make any sales while you are alone you
might forget to put the money into the drawer."</p>

<p>"Yes, I might do that."</p>

<p>"And ten to one Baker would never suspect. Of
course he doesn't know every book he has in his
store or the exact amount of stationery he keeps on
hand."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might begin that way. There couldn't be
any danger of detection."</p>

<p>This suggestion struck Roswell more favorably than
the first, as it seemed safer. Without giving any
decided answer, he suffered the thought to sink into
his mind, and occupy his thoughts.</p>

<p>The next day when about the middle of the day
Roswell found himself alone, a customer came in and
bought a package of envelopes, paying twenty-five
cents.</p>

<p>With a half-guilty feeling Roswell put this sum
into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Mr. Baker will never miss a package of envelopes,"
he thought.</p>

<p>He sold two or three other articles, but the money
received for these he put into the drawer. He did
not dare to take too much at first. Indeed, he took
a little credit to himself, so strangely had his ideas
of honesty got warped, for not taking more when he
might have done so as well as not.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker returned, and nothing was said. As
might have been expected, he did not miss the small
sum which Roswell had appropriated.</p>

<p>That evening Roswell bought a couple of cigars

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>

with the money he had stolen (we might as well call
things by their right names), and treated Ralph to
one.</p>

<p>"There's a splendid play on at Wallack's," said
he, suggestively.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'll go to-morrow evening," said Roswell.</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk," said Ralph, looking
keenly at Roswell. "Is there anything new with
you?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly," said Roswell, coloring a little,
for he did not care to own what he had done to his
companion, though it was from him that he had received
the advice.</p>

<p>The next day when Roswell was again alone, a
lady entered the shop.</p>

<p>"Have you got La Fontaine's Fables in English?"
she asked. "I have asked at half a dozen
stores, but I can't find it. I am afraid it is out of
print."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe we have it," said Roswell.</p>

<p>He remembered one day when he was looking for
a book he wanted to read, that he had come across a
shop-worn copy of La Fontaine's Fables. It was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>

on a back shelf, in an out of-the-way place. He
looked for it, and found his memory had served him
correctly.</p>

<p>"Here it is," he said, handing it down.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to get it," said the lady. "How
much will it be?"</p>

<p>"The regular price is a dollar and a quarter, but
as this is a little shop-worn you may have it for a
dollar."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>The lady drew out a dollar bill from her purse,
and handed it to Roswell.</p>

<p>He held it in his hand till she was fairly out of
the door. Then the thought came into his mind,
"Why should I not keep this money? Mr. Baker
would never know. Probably he has quite forgotten
that such a book was in his stock."</p>

<p>Besides, as the price of a ticket to the family circle
at Wallack's was only thirty cents, this sum
would carry in him and his friend, and there would
be enough left for an ice-cream after they had got
through.</p>

<p>The temptation was too much for poor Roswell
I call him poor, because I pity any boy who foolishly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>

yields to such a temptation for the sake of a
temporary gratification.</p>

<p>Roswell put the money into his vest-pocket, and
shortly afterwards Mr. Baker returned to the store.</p>

<p>"Have you sold anything, Roswell?" he inquired,
on entering.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I have sold a slate, a quire of notepaper,
and one of Oliver Optic's books."</p>

<p>Roswell showed Mr. Baker the slate, on which, as
required by his employer, he had kept a record of
sales.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker made no remark, but appeared to think
all was right.</p>

<p>So the afternoon passed away without any incident
worthy of mention.</p>

<p>In the evening Roswell met Ralph Graham, as
he had got into the habit of doing.</p>

<p>"Well, Roswell, I feel just like going to the
theatre to-night," were his first words of salutation.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll go," said Roswell.</p>

<p>"Good! You've got money to buy the tickets,
then?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Roswell, with an air of importance.
"What's the play?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a London play that's had a great run. Tom
Hastings tells me it is splendid. You take me there
to night, and I'll take you to the New York Circus
some evening next week."</p>

<p>This arrangement was very satisfactory to Roswell,
who had never visited the circus, and had a
great desire to do so. At an early hour the boys
went to the theatre, and succeeded in obtaining front
seats in the family circle. Roswell managed to enjoy
the play, although unpleasant thoughts of how
the money was obtained by which the tickets were
procured, would occasionally intrude upon him.
But the fascination of the stage kept them from
troubling him much.</p>

<p>When the performance was over, he suggested an
ice-cream.</p>

<p>"With all my heart," said Ralph. "I feel
warm and thirsty, and an ice-cream will cool my
throat."</p>

<p>So they adjourned to a confectionery establishment
nearly opposite, and Roswell, with an air of importance,
called for the creams. They sat leisurely
over them, and it was nearly half past eleven when
Roswell got home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"What keeps you out so late, Roswell?" asked
his mother, anxiously, for she was still up.</p>

<p>"I was at the theatre," said Roswell.</p>

<p>"Where did you get the money?"</p>

<p>"It's only thirty cents to the family circle," said
Roswell, carelessly. "I'm tired, and will go right
up to bed."</p>

<p>So he closed the discussion, not caring to answer
many inquiries as to his evening's amusement. His
outlay for tickets and for the ice-cream afterwards
had just used up the money he had stolen, and all
that he had to compensate for the loss of his integrity
was a headache, occasioned by late hours, and
the warm and confined atmosphere at the theatre.</p>

<p class="center">RICHARD HUNTER IS PROMOTED.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">It</span></span>
was with eager impatience that Mark awaited
the return of Richard Hunter, to communicate to
him his good luck in securing a place. The thought
that he had secured it by his own exertions gave him
great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I've got a place," were his first words, as Richard
entered the house.</p>

<p>"Already?" asked Richard Hunter. "You
have been quite smart, Mark. How did you manage
to obtain it?"</p>

<p>Mark gave the particulars, which need not be
repeated.</p>

<p>"What kind of a store is it?"</p>

<p>"A bookstore."</p>

<p>"What is the name of your employer?"</p>

<p>"Baker."</p>

<p>"Baker's bookstore!" repeated Richard, turning

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>

to Fosdick. "That is where our particular friend,
Roswell Crawford, is employed."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark; "there's a boy there about sixteen
or seventeen. I believe that is his name."</p>

<p>"I am not sure whether his being there will make
it pleasant to you. Does he know that you are a
friend of mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark; "he inquired particularly
about you, Mr. Hunter."</p>

<p>"He's very fond of me," said Dick; "I suppose he
sent me his love."</p>

<p>"No," said Mark, smiling; "he didn't speak as
if he loved you very much."</p>

<p>"He doesn't like me very much. I am afraid
when he gets to be president I shan't stand much
chance of an office. He didn't try to bully you,&mdash;did
he?"</p>

<p>"He said he could get me sent off if I wasn't
careful to please him."</p>

<p>"That sounds like Roswell."</p>

<p>"He talked as if he was one of the firm," said
Mark; "but when Mr. Baker came in, he began to
scold him for not dusting the books. After that I
didn't think so much of what he said."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a way he has," said Fosdick. "He don't
like me much either, as I got a place that he was
trying for."</p>

<p>"If he bullies you, just let me know," said
Richard. "Perhaps I can stop it."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," said Mark. "Mr. Baker is
there most of the time, and he wouldn't dare to
bully me before him."</p>

<p>Sunday morning came,&mdash;a day when the noisy
streets were hushed, and the hum of business was
stilled. Richard Hunter and Fosdick still attended
the Sunday school, to which they had now belonged
for over two years. They were still members of
Mr. Greyson's class, and were much better informed
in religious matters than formerly. Frequently&mdash;for
they were favorite scholars with Mr. Greyson&mdash;he
invited them home to dine at his handsome residence.
Both boys were now perfectly self-possessed
on such occasions. They knew how to behave at the
table with perfect decorum, and no one would have
judged from their dress, manners, or conversation,
that they had not always been accustomed to the
same style of living.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Greyson noticed with pleasure the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>

great improvement in their protegs, and always
welcomed them with kind hospitality. But there
was another member of the family who always
looked forward with pleasure to seeing them. This
was Ida, now a young lady of thirteen, who had
from the first taken an especial fancy to Dick, as she
always called him.</p>

<p>"Well, Mark," said Richard Hunter, on Sunday
morning, "wouldn't you like to go to Sunday school
with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark. "Mother always wanted me
to go to Sunday school, but she was so poor that she
could not dress me in suitable clothes."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to prevent your going now.
We shall be ready in about half an hour."</p>

<p>At the appointed time the three set out. The distance
was not great, the church being situated four
blocks farther up town on Fifth Avenue. They
chanced to meet Mr. Greyson on the church steps.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Richard. Good-morning, Henry,"
he said. Then, glancing at Mark, "Who is
your young friend?"</p>

<p>"His name is Mark Manton," said Richard.
"He is my ward."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed! I had not thought of you in the character
of a guardian," said Mr. Greyson, smiling.</p>

<p>"I should like to have him enter one of the
younger classes," said Richard.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I will gladly find a place for him.
Perhaps you can take him in your class."</p>

<p>"In my class!" repeated Richard, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought I had mentioned to you that Mr.
Benton was about to leave the city, and is obliged to
give up his class. I would like to have you take it."</p>

<p>"But am I qualified to be a teacher?" asked
Richard, who had never before thought of being invited
to take a class.</p>

<p>"I think you have excellent qualifications for
such a position. It speaks well for you, however,
that you should feel a modest hesitation on the subject."</p>

<p>"I think Fosdick would make a better teacher
than I."</p>

<p>"Oh, I intend to draft him into the service also.
I shall ask him to take the next vacancy."</p>

<p>The class assigned to our friend Dick (we are
sometimes tempted to call him by his old, familiar
name) consisted of boys of from ten to eleven years of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>

age. Among these Mark was placed. Although he
had never before attended a Sunday school, his
mother, who was an excellent woman, had given him
considerable religious instruction, so that he was
about as well advanced as the rest of the class.</p>

<p>Richard easily adapted himself to the new situation
in which he was placed. He illustrated the lesson
in a familiar and oftentimes quaint manner, so that
he easily commanded the attention of the boys, who
were surprised when the time came for the lesson to
close.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are my teacher, Mr. Hunter,"
said one of the boys at the close of the service.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Richard, who felt gratified at
the compliment. "It's new business to me, but I
hope I shall be able to interest you."</p>

<p>"Won't you come and dine with us?" asked Mr. Greyson,
as they were leaving the church.</p>

<p>Richard Hunter hesitated.</p>

<p>"I don't know if Mark can find his way home,"
he said with hesitation.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can, Mr. Hunter," said Mark. "Don't
trouble yourself about me."</p>

<p>"But I mean to have him come too," said Mr.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>

Greyson. "Our table is a large one, as you know,
and we can accommodate three as well as two."</p>

<p>"Do come, Dick," said Ida Greyson.</p>

<p>Richard was seldom able to resist a request preferred
by Ida, and surrendered at discretion. So, as
usual, Fosdick walked on with Mr. Greyson, this
time with Mark beside him, while Richard walked
with Ida.</p>

<p>"Who is that little boy, Dick?" asked the young
lady.</p>

<p>"That's my ward, Miss Ida," said Richard.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you are his guardian,
Dick?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe I am."</p>

<p>"Why," said the lively young lady, "I always
thought guardians were old, and cross, and bald-headed."</p>

<p>"I don't know but that description will suit me
after a while," said Dick. "My hair has been coming
out lately."</p>

<p>"Has it, really?" said Ida, who took this seriously.
"I hope you won't be bald. I don't think you
would look well."</p>

<p>"But I might wear a wig."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't like wigs," said the young lady, decidedly.
"If you were a lady now, you might
wear a cap. How funny you'd look in a cap!"
and she burst out into a peal of merry laughter.</p>

<p>"I think a cap would be more becoming to you,"
said Richard.</p>

<p>"Do you ever scold your ward?" asked Ida.</p>

<p>"No, he's a pretty good boy. He don't need
it."</p>

<p>"Where did you get acquainted with him? Have
you known him long?"</p>

<p>"He was taken sick at the door of our office one
day. So I had him carried to my boarding-place,
and took care of him till he got well."</p>

<p>"That was very good of you," said Ida, approvingly.
"What did he use to do?"</p>

<p>"He was a match boy."</p>

<p>"Does he sell matches now?"</p>

<p>"No; he has got a place in a bookstore."</p>

<p>"What did you say his name was?"</p>

<p>"Mark."</p>

<p>"That's a pretty good name, but I don't like it so
well as Dick."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," said Richard. "I am glad you
like my name."</p>

<p>At this moment they were passing the Fifth Avenue
Hotel. Standing on the steps were two acquaintances
of ours, Roswell Crawford and Ralph
Graham. They had cigars in their mouths, and
there was a swaggering air about them, which was
not likely to prepossess any sensible person in their
favor. They had not been to church, but had
spent the morning in sauntering about the city,
finally bringing up at the Fifth Avenue Hotel,
where, posting themselves conspicuously on the
steps, they watched the people passing by on their
way from church.</p>

<p>Richard Hunter bowed to Roswell, as it was his
rule never to be found wanting in politeness. Roswell
was ill-mannered enough not to return the salutation.</p>

<p>"Who is that, Roswell?" asked Ralph Graham.</p>

<p>"It's a boot-black," said Roswell, sneeringly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? I am speaking of that
nice-looking young fellow that bowed to you just
now."</p>

<p>"His name is Hunter. He used to be a boot-black,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>

as I told you; but he's got up in the world,
and now he's putting on airs."</p>

<p>"He seems to have got into good company, at any
rate. He is walking with the daughter of Mr.
Greyson, a rich merchant down town."</p>

<p>"He's got impudence enough for anything," said
Roswell, with a feeling of bitter envy which he could
not conceal. "It really makes me sick to see
him strutting about as if he were a gentleman's
son."</p>

<p>"Like you," suggested Ralph, slyly; for he had
already been informed by Roswell, on various occasions,
that he was "a gentleman's son."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Roswell, "I'm a gentleman's son, if
I'm not so lucky as some people. Did you see that
small boy in front?"</p>

<p>"Walking with Mr. Greyson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so."</p>

<p>"What of him?"</p>

<p>"That's our errand boy."</p>

<p>"Is it?" asked Ralph, in some surprise. "He
seems to be one of the lucky kind too."</p>

<p>"He sold matches about the streets till a few
weeks ago," said Roswell, spitefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"He sold them to some purpose, it seems, for he's
evidently going home to dine with Mr. Greyson."</p>

<p>"Mr. Greyson seems to be very fond of low company.
That's all I can say."</p>

<p>"When you and I get to be as rich as he is, we
can choose our own company."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall choose better than he."</p>

<p>"Well, let's drop them," said Ralph, who was
getting tired of the subject. "I must be getting
home to dinner."</p>

<p>"So must I."</p>

<p>"Come round to my room, after dinner, and we'll
have another smoke."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come round. I suppose mother'll be
wanting me to go to church with her, but I've got
tired of going to church."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE MADISON CLUB.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">Two</span></span>
days afterwards, when Roswell as usual met
his friend Ralph, the latter said, with an air of importance:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've got news for you, Roswell."</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired Roswell.</p>

<p>"You've been unanimously elected a member of
our club."</p>

<p>"Your club?"</p>

<p>"Yes; didn't I ever mention it to you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, I believe I didn't. You see I intended
to propose your name as a member, and not feeling
certain whether you would be elected, I thought I
had better not mention it to you."</p>

<p>"What is the name of the club?" asked Roswell,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"The Madison Club."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"What made you call it that?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, there's one fellow in the club
that lives on Madison Avenue, and we thought that
would be an aristocratic name, so we chose it."</p>

<p>Roswell liked whatever was aristocratic, and the
name pleased him.</p>

<p>"Did you say I was unanimously elected, Ralph?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; I proposed your name at our meeting last
night. It was on account of that, that I couldn't
meet you as usual. But hereafter we can go together
to the meetings."</p>

<p>"How many fellows belong?"</p>

<p>"Twenty. We don't mean to have more than
twenty-five. We are quite particular whom we
elect."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Roswell, in a tone of importance.
"You wouldn't want a set of low fellows
like that Dick Hunter."</p>

<p>"No. By the way, I've got somewhere your
notification from the secretary. Here it is."</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a note adorned with a
large and elaborate seal, which Roswell, opening
found read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"MADISON CLUB.<br />
<br />
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Roswell Crawford</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>"Sir:&mdash;I have the honor of informing you that at the
last regular meeting of the Madison Club you were unanimously
elected a member.</p>

<p>
"Yours respectfully,<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">James Tracy</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This document Roswell read with much satisfaction.
It sounded well to say that he was a member
of the Madison Club, and his unanimous election
could only be regarded as a high compliment.</p>

<p>"I will join," he said, pompously. "When is
the next meeting?"</p>

<p>"Next Tuesday evening."</p>

<p>"Where does the society meet?"</p>

<p>"In a room on Fourth Avenue. You can come
round early, and we will go together."</p>

<p>"All right. What do you do at the meetings?"</p>

<p>"Well, we smoke, and tell stories, and have a
good time. Generally there are some eatables provided.
However, you'll know all about it, when you
join. Oh, by the way, there's one thing I forgot to
tell you," added Ralph. "There's an initiation fee
of five dollars."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"A fee of five dollars!" repeated Roswell, soberly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is it for?"</p>

<p>"To defray expenses, of course. There's the
rent, and lights, and stationery, and the eatables.
They always, I think, have an initiation fee at
clubs."</p>

<p>"Are there any other expenses?"</p>

<p>"Not much. There's only a dollar a month.
That isn't much."</p>

<p>"I don't know how I'm going to raise the five
dollars," said Roswell, soberly. "I could manage
the dollar a month afterwards."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll think of some way," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"My mother wouldn't give it to me, so there's no
use asking her."</p>

<p>"Why can't you pay it out of your extra wages?"
said Ralph, significantly.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't dare to take such a large sum," said
Roswell. "They would find me out."</p>

<p>"Not if you're careful."</p>

<p>"They don't keep but a few dollars in the drawer
at one time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"But didn't you tell me there was another
drawer?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but that is always kept locked."</p>

<p>"Open it then."</p>

<p>"I have no key."</p>

<p>"Get one that will fit it then."</p>

<p>"I don't like to do that."</p>

<p>"Well, it's nothing to me," said Ralph, "only I
should like to have you belong to the club, and you
can't unless you are able to pay the initiation fee."</p>

<p>"I would like very much to belong," said Roswell,
irresolutely.</p>

<p>"I know you would enjoy it. We have splendid
times."</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can do to raise the money," said
Roswell.</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk. You'll manage to get
it some way."</p>

<p>It was a great temptation to Roswell. The more
he thought of it, the more he thought he should like
to say that he was a member of the Madison Club.
He had a weak love of gentility, and he was persuaded
that it would improve his social standing.
But he did not wish to adopt the course recommended

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>

by Ralph if there was any other way of getting the
money. He determined, therefore, first to make the
effort to obtain the money from his mother on some
pretext or other. By the time he reached home,
which was at an earlier hour than usual, he had arranged
his pretext.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are home early," said Mrs.
Crawford.</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought I'd come home early to-night.
Mother, I wish you'd let me have four dollars."</p>

<p>"What for, Roswell?"</p>

<p>"I want to buy a new hat. This one is getting
shabby."</p>

<p>Roswell's plan was, if he could obtain the four
dollars from his mother, to make up the extra dollar
out of sales unaccounted for. As to the failure
to buy the hat, he could tell his mother that he had
lost the money, or make some other excuse. That
thought did not trouble him much. But he was not
destined to succeed.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you are dissatisfied with your hat,
Roswell," said Mrs. Crawford, "for I cannot possibly
spare you the money now."</p>

<p>"So you always say," grumbled Roswell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it's true," said his mother. "I'm very
short just now. The rent comes due in a few days,
and I am trying hard to get together money enough
to pay it."</p>

<p>"I thought you had money coming in from your
lodgers."</p>

<p>"There's Mr. Bancroft hasn't paid me for six
weeks, and I'm afraid I am going to lose his room-rent.
It's hard work for a woman to get along.
Everybody takes advantage of her," said Mrs. Crawford,
sighing.</p>

<p>"Can't you possibly let me have the money by
Saturday, mother?"</p>

<p>"No, Roswell. Perhaps in a few weeks I can.
But I don't think your hat looks bad. You can go
and get it pressed if you wish."</p>

<p>But Roswell declared that wouldn't do, and left
the room in an ill-humor. Instead of feeling for his
mother, and wishing to help her, he was intent only
upon his own selfish gratifications.</p>

<p>So much, then, was plain,&mdash;in his efforts to raise
the money for the initiation fee at the club, he
could not expect any help from his mother. He
must rely upon other means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Gradually Roswell came to the determination to
follow the dangerous advice which had been proffered
him by Ralph Graham. He could not bear to give
up the project of belonging to the club, and was willing
to commit a dishonest act rather than forego the
opportunity.</p>

<p>He began to think now of the manner in which he
could accomplish what he had in view. The next
day when noon came he went round to the locked
drawer, and, lighting a piece of sealing-wax which he
had taken from one of the cases, he obtained a clear
impression of the lock.</p>

<p>"I think that will do," thought Roswell.</p>

<p>At that moment a customer entered the store, and
he hurried the stick of sealing-wax into his pocket.</p>

<p>When the store closed, Roswell went round to a
locksmith, whose sign he remembered to have seen
in Third Avenue.</p>

<p>He entered the shop with a guilty feeling at his
heart, though he had a plausible story arranged for
the occasion.</p>

<p>"I want a key made," he said, in a business-like
manner; "one that will fit this lock."</p>

<p>Here he displayed the wax impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"What sort of a lock is it?" asked the locksmith,
looking at it.</p>

<p>"It is a bureau drawer," said Roswell. "We
have lost the key, and can't open it. So I took the
impression in wax. How soon can you let me have
it?"</p>

<p>"Are you in a hurry for it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; didn't I tell you we couldn't open the
drawer?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll try to let you have it by to-morrow
night."</p>

<p>"That will do," said Roswell.</p>

<p>He left the locksmith's shop with mixed feelings
of satisfaction and shame at the thought of the use
to which he was intending to put the key. It was a
great price he had determined to pay for the honor
of belonging to the Madison Club.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">ROSWELL JOINS THE MADISON CLUB.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">It</span></span>
was not until Saturday night that Roswell obtained
the key. The locksmith, like tradesmen and
mechanics in general, kept putting him off, to Roswell's
great annoyance.</p>

<p>As he did not get the key till Saturday night, of
course there would be no opportunity of using it till
Monday. The only time then was the hour in which
Mr. Baker and Mr. Jones were absent, and Roswell
was left alone. But to his great vexation, an old
gentleman came in directly after Mr. Baker went
out, and inquired for him.</p>

<p>"He's gone to dinner," said Roswell.</p>

<p>"I think I'll wait till he returns," said the
visitor, coolly sitting down in Mr. Baker's arm-chair.</p>

<p>Roswell was in dismay, for this would of course
prevent his using the key which he had taken so
much trouble to obtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Baker is always out a good while," said
Roswell.</p>

<p>"Never mind, I can wait for him. I came in
from the country this morning, and shall not need to
start back till four."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Roswell, "you could go
out and do the rest of your errands, and come back
at two o'clock. Mr. Baker will be sure to be back
then."</p>

<p>"Who told you I had any more errands to do?"
asked the old gentleman, sharply.</p>

<p>"I thought you might have," said Roswell, somewhat
confused.</p>

<p>"You are very considerate; but, as my business is
over for the day, I will ask your permission to remain
till my nephew returns."</p>

<p>So this was Mr. Baker's uncle, a shrewd old gentlemen,
if he did live in the country.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Roswell, but not with a very
good grace, adding to himself; "there'll be no
chance for me to get the money to-day. I hope the
old fellow won't come round again to-morrow."</p>

<p>The next day was Tuesday. In the evening the
club was to meet, so there was no time to lose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately, as Roswell thought, the coast was
clear.</p>

<p>"Suppose the key won't fit?" he thought with
uneasiness.</p>

<p>It would have been lucky for Roswell if the key
had not fitted. But it proved to fit exactly. Turning
it in the lock, the drawer opened, and before him
lay a pile of bills.</p>

<p>How much or how little there might be Roswell
did not stop to examine. He knew that a customer
might come in at any time, and he must do at
once what he meant to do. At the top of the pile
there was a five-dollar bill. He took it, slipped it
hastily into his vest-pocket, relocked the drawer,
and, walking away from it, began to dust the books
upon the counter.</p>

<p>He felt that he had taken the decisive step. He
was supplied with the necessary money to pay the
initiation fee. The question was, would Mr. Baker
find it out?</p>

<p>Suppose he should, how would it be possible to
evade suspicion, or to throw it upon some one
else?</p>

<p>"If I could make him think it was the match

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>

boy," thought Roswell, "I should be killing two
birds with one stone. I must see what can be done."</p>

<p>When Mr. Baker returned, Roswell feared he would
go to the drawer, but he did not seem inclined to do
this.</p>

<p>He just entered the store, and said, "Mr. Jones,
I am obliged to go over to Brooklyn on a little business,
and I may not be back this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>Roswell breathed freer after he had left the shop.
It had occurred to him as possible that if the money
were missed, he might be searched, in which case
the key and the bill in his pocket would be enough
to convict him. Now he should not see Mr. Baker
again till the next day probably, when the money
would be disposed of.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker, as he anticipated, did not return from
Brooklyn before Roswell left the store.</p>

<p>Roswell snatched a hasty supper, and went over to
his friend, Ralph Graham's room, immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, Roswell," said Ralph; "are
you coming to the club with me to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Roswell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you got the five dollars?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How did you manage it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I contrived to get it," said Roswell, who did
not like to confess in what way he had secured possession
of the money.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all right, as long as you've got it. I
was afraid you wouldn't succeed."</p>

<p>"So was I," said Roswell. "I had hard work of
it. What time do the club meetings begin?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"At eight o'clock, but I generally go round about
half an hour before. Generally, some of the fellows
are there, and we can have a social chat. I guess
we'll go round at half-past seven, and that will give
me a chance to introduce you to some of the members
before the meeting begins."</p>

<p>"I should like that," said Roswell.</p>

<p>In a short time the boys set out. They paused
before a small house on Fourth Avenue, and rang the
bell. The summons was answered by a colored
man.</p>

<p>"Any members of the club upstairs?" inquired
Ralph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the attendant. "There's Mr.
Tracy, Mr. Wilmot, and Mr. Burgess."</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll go up."</p>

<p>"Jackson," said Ralph, "this gentleman is Mr.
Crawford, a new member."</p>

<p>"Glad to make your acquaintance, sir," said
Jackson.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Roswell.</p>

<p>"Jackson takes care of the club-room," explained
Ralph, "and is in attendance to admit the members
on club nights. Now let us go upstairs."</p>

<p>They went up one flight of stairs, and opened the
door of a back room.</p>

<p>It was not a very imposing-looking apartment, being
only about twenty feet square, the floor covered with
a faded carpet, while the furniture was not particularly
sumptuous. At one end of the room was a table,
behind which were two arm-chairs.</p>

<p>"That is where the president and secretary sit,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>There were already three or four youths in the
room. One of them came forward and offered his
hand to Ralph.</p>

<p>"How are you, Graham?" he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"How are you, Tracy?" returned Ralph.
"This is Mr. Crawford, who was elected a member
at our last meeting. Roswell, this is Mr. Tracy,
our secretary."</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, Mr. Crawford," said
Tracy. "I hope you received the notification of
your election which I sent you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Roswell. "I am much obliged to
you."</p>

<p>"I hope you intend to accept."</p>

<p>"It will give me great pleasure," said Roswell.
"You must have very pleasant meetings."</p>

<p>"I hope you will find them pleasant. By the
way, here is our president, Mr. Brandon. Brandon,
let me introduce you to a new member of our society,
Mr. Crawford."</p>

<p>The president, who was a tall young man of
eighteen, bowed graciously to Roswell.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crawford," said he, "allow me, in the name
of the society, to bid you welcome to our gay and
festive meetings. We are a band of good fellows,
who like to meet together and have a social time.
We are proud to receive you into our ranks."</p>

<p>"And I am very glad to belong," said Roswell,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>

who felt highly pleased at the cordial manner in
which he was received.</p>

<p>"You'd better go to the secretary, and enter your
name in the books of the club," suggested Ralph.
"You can pay him the five dollars at the same time.
Here, Tracy, Mr. Crawford wants to enroll his
name."</p>

<p>"All right," said Tracy; "walk this way if you
please, Mr. Crawford."</p>

<p>Roswell wrote down his name, residence, and the
store where he was employed.</p>

<p>"I see, Mr. Crawford, you are engaged in literary
pursuits," said the secretary.</p>

<p>"Yes, for the present," said Roswell. "I don't
think I shall remain long, as the book business
doesn't give me scope enough; but I shall not leave
at present, as it might inconvenience Mr. Baker.
What is your initiation fee?"</p>

<p>"Five dollars."</p>

<p>"I happen to have the money with me, I believe,"
said Roswell. "Here it is."</p>

<p>"Thank you; that is right. I will enter you as
paid. The monthly assessments are one dollar, as
perhaps Graham told you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I think he mentioned it. It is quite reasonable,
I think," said Roswell, in a tone which
seemed to indicate that he was never at a loss for
money.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so, considering our expenses. You
see we have to pay for the room; then we pay
Jackson's wages, and there are cigars, etc., for the
use of the members. Have you ever before belonged
to a club?"</p>

<p>"No," said Roswell. "I have always declined
hitherto (he had never before received an invitation)
but I was so much pleased with what I heard of the
Madison Club from my friend Graham, that I determined
to join. I am glad that you are particular
whom you admit as members of the club."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we are very exclusive," said Tracy.
"We are not willing to admit anybody and everybody."</p>

<p>Meanwhile there had been numerous arrivals, until
probably nearly all the members of the club were
present.</p>

<p>"Order, gentlemen!" said the president, assuming
the chair, and striking the table at the same
time. "The club will please come to order."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a momentary confusion, but at length
the members settled into their seats, and silence prevailed.
Roswell Crawford took a seat beside Ralph
Graham.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A CLUB NIGHT.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">"The</span></span>
secretary will read the journal of the last
meeting," said President Brandon.</p>

<p>Tracy rose, and read a brief report, which was
accepted, according to form.</p>

<p>"Is there any business to come before the club?"
inquired the president.</p>

<p>"I would like to nominate a friend of mine as a
member of the club," said Burgess.</p>

<p>"What's his name?" inquired a member.</p>

<p>"Henry Drayton."</p>

<p>"Will Mr. Burgess give some account of his friend,
so that the members can vote intelligently on his
election?" requested Brandon.</p>

<p>"He's a jolly sort of fellow, and a good singer,"
said Burgess. "He'll help make our meetings
lively. He's about my age&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In his second childhood," suggested Wilmot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>This produced a laugh at the expense of Burgess,
who took it good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Has he got five dollars?" inquired another
member.</p>

<p>"His father is a rich man," said Burgess.
"There will be no fear about his not paying his
assessments."</p>

<p>"That's the principal thing," said Wilmot. "I
second the nomination."</p>

<p>A vote was taken which was unanimously affirmative.</p>

<p>"Mr. Drayton is unanimously elected a member
of the Madison Club," announced the president.
"Notification will be duly sent him by the secretary.
Is there any other business to come before the
club?"</p>

<p>As there appeared to be none, Brandon added,
"Then we will proceed to the more agreeable duties
which have brought us hither."</p>

<p>He rang a small bell.</p>

<p>Jackson answered the summons.</p>

<p>"Jackson, is the punch ready?" inquired the
president.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Jackson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then bring it in. I appoint Wilmot and Burgess
to lend you the necessary aid."</p>

<p>A large flagon of hot whiskey punch was brought
in and placed on a table. Glasses were produced
from a closet in the corner of the room, and it was
served out to the members.</p>

<p>"How do you like it, Roswell?" inquired Ralph
Graham.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;rather strong," said Roswell, coughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll soon be used to it. The fellows will
begin to be jolly after they've drunk a glass or
two."</p>

<p>"Do they ever get tight?" whispered Roswell.</p>

<p>"A little lively,&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>The effect predicted soon followed.</p>

<p>"Wilmot, give us a song," said Burgess.</p>

<p>"What will you have?" said Wilmot, whose
flushed face showed that the punch had begun to
affect him.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can give us an air from one of the
operas."</p>

<p>"Villikens and his Dinah?" suggested Tracy.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Wilmot.</p>

<p>Wilmot was one of those, who, with no voice or

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>

musical ear, are under the delusion that they are
admirable singers. He executed the song in his
usual style, and was rewarded with vociferous
applause, which appeared to gratify him.</p>

<p>"Gentleman," he said, laying his hand upon his
heart, "I am deeply grateful for your kind appreciation
of my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Admirable singing," suggested Dunbar.</p>

<p>"Of my admirable singing," repeated Wilmot,
gravely.</p>

<p>This speech was naturally followed by an outburst
of laughter. Wilmot looked around him in
grave surprise.</p>

<p>"I don't see what you fellows are laughing at,"
he said, "unless you're all drunk."</p>

<p>He sat down amid a round of applause, evidently
puzzled to understand the effect of his words.</p>

<p>After this, David Green arose, and rehearsed amid
great applause a stump speech which he had heard
at some minstrel entertainment which he had attended.</p>

<p>"How do you like it, Roswell?" again inquired
Ralph Graham.</p>

<p>"It's splendid," said Roswell, enthusiastically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you glad you joined?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I wouldn't have missed it for a good
deal."</p>

<p>"I knew you'd say so. Have your glass filled.
Here Jackson, fill this gentleman's glass."</p>

<p>Roswell was beginning to feel a little light-headed;
but the punch had excited him, and he had become
in a degree reckless of consequences. So he made
no opposition to the proposal, but held out his glass,
which was soon returned to him filled to the
brim.</p>

<p>"Speech from the new member!" called Dunbar,
after a while.</p>

<p>"Yes, speech, speech!"</p>

<p>All eyes were turned towards Roswell.</p>

<p>"You'd better say something," said Ralph.</p>

<p>Roswell rose to his feet, but found it necessary to
hold on to his chair for support.</p>

<p>"Mr. President," commenced Roswell, gazing
about him in a vacant way, "this is a great occasion."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Burgess.</p>

<p>"We are assembled to-night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So we are. Bright boy!" said David Green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am a gentleman's son," continued Roswell.</p>

<p>"What's the gentleman's name?" interrupted
Wilmot.</p>

<p>"And I think it's a shame that I should only be
paid six dollars a week for my services."</p>

<p>"Bring your employer here, and we'll lynch
him," said Tracy. "Such mean treatment of a
member of the Madison Club should meet with the
severest punishment. Go ahead."</p>

<p>"I don't think I've got anything more to say,"
said Roswell. "As my head doesn't feel just right,
I'll sit down."</p>

<p>There was a round of applause, and Wilmot arose.</p>

<p>"Mr. President," he said, gravely, "I have been
very much impressed with the remarks of the gentleman
who has just sat down. They do equal credit
to his head and his heart. His reference to his
salary was most touching. If you will allow me, I
will pause a moment and wipe away an unbidden
tear." (Here amid laughter and applause, Wilmot
made an imposing demonstration with a large handkerchief.
He then proceeded.) "Excuse my emotion,
gentlemen. I merely arose to make the motion
that the gentleman should furnish us a copy of his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>

remarks, that they may be engrossed on parchment,
and a copy sent to the principal libraries in Europe
and America."</p>

<p>Roswell was hardly in a condition to understand
that fun was being made of him, but listened soberly,
sipping from time to time from his glass.</p>

<p>"The motion is not in order," said Brandon.
"The hour for business has gone by."</p>

<p>The punch was now removed, and cards were produced.
The remainder of the evening was spent in
playing euchre and other games. Roswell took a
hand, but found he was too dizzy to play correctly,
and for the remainder of the evening contented himself
with looking on. Small sums were staked among
some of the players, and thus a taste for gambling
was fostered which might hereafter lead to moral
shipwreck and ruin.</p>

<p>This was the way in which the members of the
Madison Club spent their evenings,&mdash;a very poor
way, as my young readers will readily acknowledge.
I heartily approve of societies organized by young
people for debate and mutual improvement. They
are oftentimes productive of great good. Some of
our distinguished men date their first impulse to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>

improve and advance themselves to their connection
with such a society. But the Madison Club had no
salutary object in view. It was adapted to inspire
a taste for gambling and drinking, and the money
spent by the members to sustain it was worse than
wasted.</p>

<p>Roswell, however, who would have found nothing
to interest or attract him in a Debating Society, was
very favorably impressed by what he had seen of the
Madison Club. He got an erroneous impression
that it was likely to introduce him into the society
of gentlemen, and his aristocratic predilections were,
as we know, one of Roswell's hobbies.</p>

<p>It was about eleven when the club broke up its
meeting. Previous to this there was a personal difficulty
between Wilmot and Tracy, which resulted in
a rough-and-tumble fight, in which Wilmot got the
worst of it. How the quarrel arose no one could
remember,&mdash;the principals least of all. At last they
were reconciled, and were persuaded to shake hands.</p>

<p>They issued into the street, a noisy throng. Roswell's
head ached, the punch, to which he was not
accustomed, having affected him in this way. Besides
this he felt a little dizzy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you'd come home with me, Ralph," he
said to his friend. "I don't feel quite right."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll feel all right to-morrow. Your head
will become as strong as mine after a while. I'm as
cool as a cucumber."</p>

<p>"It's rather late, isn't it?" asked Roswell.</p>

<p>"Hark, there's the clock striking. I'll count
the strokes. Eleven o'clock!" he said, after counting.
"That isn't very late."</p>

<p>Ralph accompanied Roswell to the door of his
mother's house in Clinton Place.</p>

<p>"Good-night, old fellow!" he said. "You'll be
all right in the morning."</p>

<p>"Good-night," said Roswell.</p>

<p>He crept up to bed, but his brain was excited by
the punch he had drank, and it was only after tossing
about for two hours that he at length sank into
a troubled sleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">WHO WAS THE THIEF?<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">When</span></span>
Roswell rose the next morning he felt
cross and out of sorts. His head still ached a little,
and he wished he were not obliged to go to the store.
But it was out of the question to remain at home, so
he started about half an hour after the usual time,
and of course arrived late.</p>

<p>"You are late this morning," said Mr. Baker.
"You must be more particular about being here
in good season."</p>

<p>Roswell muttered something about not feeling
quite well.</p>

<p>Putting his hand into his pocket by chance, his
fingers came in contact with the key which he had
made to open the cash drawer. Just as he was passing
Mark, he drew it out and let it drop into the
side-pocket of his jacket. So, if suspicion were excited,
the key would be found on Mark, not on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>The critical moment came sooner than he had anticipated.</p>

<p>A Mr. Gay, one of the regular customers of the
bookstore, entered a few minutes later.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Baker," he said. "Have
you got a 'Tribune' this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here is one. By the way, you are just
the man I wanted to see."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I feel complimented."</p>

<p>"Wait till you hear what I am going to say. You
bought a copy of 'Corinne' here on Monday?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And handed me a five-dollar bill on the Park
Bank?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I find the bill was a skilfully executed
counterfeit."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I didn't examine it very closely. But
I know where I took it, and will give you a good bill
in exchange for it."</p>

<p>"I locked it up lest it should get out," said Mr.
Baker.</p>

<p>He went to the drawer which Roswell had opened.
Roswell listened to this conversation with dismay.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>

He realized that he was in a tight place, for it was
undoubtedly the five-dollar counterfeit which he had
taken, and paid to the Secretary of the Madison
Club. He awaited nervously the result of Mr.
Baker's examination.</p>

<p>"Don't you find it?" asked Mr. Gay.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," said Mr. Baker. "I placed
it at the top of a pile of bills, and now it is
gone."</p>

<p>"Look through the pile. Perhaps your memory
is at fault," said Mr. Gay.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker did so.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "the bill has disappeared."</p>

<p>"Do you miss anything else?"</p>

<p>"No. The money is just five dollars short."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you forget yourself, and paid it away to
a customer."</p>

<p>"Impossible; I always make change out of this
drawer."</p>

<p>"Well, when you find it, I will make it right. I
am in a hurry this morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Gay went out.</p>

<p>"Has any one been to this drawer?" inquired
Mr. Baker, abruptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"You always keep it locked,&mdash;do you not?" said
Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>"And keep the key myself. Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see how it could have been
opened."</p>

<p>"There was nothing peculiar about the lock.
There might easily be another key to fit it."</p>

<p>"I hope you don't suspect me, Mr. Baker?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Jones, you have been with me five
years, and I have perfect confidence in you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"I hope you don't suspect me, sir," said Roswell,
boldly. "I am willing to turn my pockets inside-out,
to show that I have no key that will fit the
lock."</p>

<p>"Very well. You may do so."</p>

<p>Roswell turned his pockets inside-out, but of
course no key was found.</p>

<p>"How lucky I got rid of it!" he thought.</p>

<p>"Now it's your turn, Mark," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm perfectly willing," said Mark, promptly.</p>

<p>He put his hand into his pocket, and, to his
unutterable astonishment and dismay, drew out a
key.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't know I had this in my pocket," he said,
startled.</p>

<p>"Hand me that key," said Mr. Baker, sternly.</p>

<p>Mark handed it to him mechanically.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker went behind the counter, and fitted the
key in the lock. It proved to open the drawer with
ease.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this key?" he said.</p>

<p>"I didn't know I had it, sir," said Mark, earnestly.
"I hope you will believe me."</p>

<p>"I don't understand how you can hope anything
of the kind. It seems very clear that you have been
at my drawer, and taken the missing money. When
did you take it?"</p>

<p>"I have never opened the drawer, nor taken your
money," said Mark, in a firm voice, though his
cheek was pale, and his look was troubled.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that I do not believe you,"
said Mr. Baker, coldly. "Once more, when did
you take the five dollars?"</p>

<p>"I did not take it at all, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you lent the key to any one?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I did not know I had it."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do in the matter," said the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>

bookseller, turning to Mr. Jones, his assistant. "It
seems clear to me that the boy took the missing
bill."</p>

<p>"I am afraid so," said Jones, who was a kind-hearted
man, and pitied Mark. "But I don't know
when he could have had the chance. He is never
left alone in the store."</p>

<p>"Roswell," said Mr. Baker, "have you left
Mark alone in the store at any time within two or
three days?"</p>

<p>Roswell saw the point of the inquiry, and determined,
as a measure of safety, to add falsehood to
his former offence.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said, in an apologetic tone, "I left
him in the store for two or three minutes yesterday."</p>

<p>"Why did you leave him? Did you go out of
the store?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. A friend was passing, and I went out
to speak to him. I don't think I stayed more than
two or three minutes."</p>

<p>"And Mark was left alone in the store?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I had no idea that any harm would
come of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark looked intently at Roswell when he uttered
this falsehood.</p>

<p>"You had better confess, Mark, that you took the
money when Roswell was out of the store," said his
employer. "If you make a full confession, I will
be as lenient with you as I can, considering your
youth."</p>

<p>"Mr. Baker," said Mark, quietly, more at his
ease now, since he began to understand that there
was a plot against him, "I cannot confess what is
not true. I don't know what Roswell means by what
he has just said, but I was not left alone in the
store for a moment all day yesterday, nor did Roswell
go out to speak to a friend while I was
about."</p>

<p>"There seems to be a conflict of evidence here,"
said Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>"I hope the word of a gentleman's son is worth
more than that of a match boy," said Roswell,
haughtily.</p>

<p>"To whom do you refer, when you speak of a
match boy?"</p>

<p>"To <em>him</em>," said Roswell, pointing to Mark.
"He used to be a vagabond boy about the streets

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>

selling matches, and sleeping anywhere he could.
No wonder he steals."</p>

<p>"I never stole in my life," said Mark, indignantly.
"It is true that I sold matches about the streets,
and I should have been doing it now, if it had not
been for my meeting with kind friends."</p>

<p>"As to his having been a match boy, that has no
bearing upon the question," said Mr. Baker. "It
is the discovery of the key in his pocket that throws
the gravest suspicion upon him. I must see his
friends, and inquire into the matter."</p>

<p>"Of course they will stand by him," said Roswell.</p>

<p>"We may get some light thrown upon his possession
of the key, at any rate, and can judge for ourselves."</p>

<p>"I shall keep you employed until this matter is
investigated," said Mr. Baker to Mark. "Here is a
parcel of books to be carried to Twenty-Seventh
Street. Come back as soon as they are delivered."</p>

<p>Mark went out with a heavy heart, for it troubled
him to think he was under suspicion. Theft, too, he
had always despised. He wondered if Richard
Hunter would believe him guilty. He could not

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>

bear to think that so kind a friend should think so ill
of him.</p>

<p>But Mark's vindication was not long in coming.
He had been out scarcely ten minutes when Roswell,
on looking up, saw to his dismay Tracy, the secretary
of the Madison Club, entering the store. His
heart misgave him as to the nature of the business
on which he had probably come.</p>

<p>He went forward hastily to meet him.</p>

<p>"How are you, Crawford?" said Tracy.</p>

<p>"Pretty well. I am very busy now. I will see
you, after the store closes, anywhere you please."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Tracy, in a voice loud enough for Mr.
Baker to hear, "it won't take a minute. The bill
you gave me last night was a bad one. Of course
you didn't know it."</p>

<p>Roswell turned red and pale, and hoped Mr.
Baker did not hear. But Mr. Baker had caught
the words, and came forward.</p>

<p>"Show me the bill, if you please, young gentleman,"
he said. "I have a good reason for asking."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," said Tracy, rather surprised.
"Here it is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>A moment's glance satisfied Mr. Baker that it was
the missing bill.</p>

<p>"Did Roswell pay you this bill?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"For what did he owe it?"</p>

<p>"I am the secretary of the Madison Club, and
this was paid as the entrance fee."</p>

<p>"I recognize the bill," said Mr. Baker. "I will
take it, if you please, and you can look to him for
another."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Tracy, puzzled by the words,
the motive of which he did not understand.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will explain this," said Mr. Baker,
turning to Roswell. "It seems that you took this
bill."</p>

<p>Roswell's confidence deserted him, and he stood
pale and downcast.</p>

<p>"The key I presume, belonged to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he ejaculated, with difficulty.</p>

<p>"And you dropped it into Mark's pocket,&mdash;thus
meanly trying to implicate him in a theft which you
had yourself committed."</p>

<p>Roswell was silent.</p>

<p>"Have you taken money before?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never opened the drawer but once."</p>

<p>"That was not my question. Make a full confession,
and I will not have you arrested, but shall
require you to make restitution of all the sums you
have stolen. I shall not include this bill, as it is
now returned to my possession. Here is a piece of
paper. Write down the items."</p>

<p>Roswell did so. They footed up a little over six
dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker examined it.</p>

<p>"Is this all?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Half a week's wages are due you, I will therefore
deduct three dollars from this amount. The remainder
I shall expect you to refund. I shall have
no further occasion for your services."</p>

<p>Roswell took his cap, and was about to leave the
store.</p>

<p>"Wait a few minutes. You have tried to implicate
Mark in your theft. You must wait till his
return, and apologize to him for what you have
attempted to do."</p>

<p>"Must I do this?" asked Roswell, ruefully.</p>

<p>"You must," said Mr. Baker, firmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mark came in, and was told how he had
been cleared of suspicion, he felt very happy. Roswell
made the apology dictated to him, with a very
bad grace, and then was permitted to leave the store.</p>

<p>At home he tried to hide the circumstances attending
his discharge from his mother and his
cousin; but the necessity of refunding the money
made that impossible.</p>

<p>It was only a few days afterwards that Mrs.
Crawford received a letter, informing her of the death
of a brother in Illinois, and that he had left her a
small house and farm. She had found it so hard a
struggle for a livelihood in the city, that she decided
to remove thither, greatly to Roswell's disgust, who
did not wish to be immured in the country. But
his wishes could not be gratified, and, sulky and discontented,
he was obliged to leave the choice society
of the Madison Club, and the attractions of New
York, for the quiet of a country town. Let us
hope that, away from the influences of the city, his
character may be improved, and become more manly
and self-reliant. It is only just to say that he was
led to appropriate what did not belong to him, by the
desire to gratify his vanity, and through the influence

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>

of a bad adviser. If he can ever forget that
he is "the son of a gentleman," I shall have some
hopes for him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">AN EXCURSION TO FORT HAMILTON.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">Towards</span></span>
the close of May there was a general
holiday, occasioned by the arrival of a distinguished
stranger in the city. All the stores were to be
closed, there was to be a turnout of the military,
and a long procession. Among those released from
duty were our three friends, Fosdick, Richard Hunter,
and his ward Mark.</p>

<p>"Well, Dick, what are you going to do to-morrow?"
inquired Fosdick, on the evening previous.</p>

<p>"I was expecting an invitation to ride in a
barouche with the mayor," said Richard; "but probably
he forgot my address and couldn't send it. On
the whole I'm glad of it, being rather bashful and
not used to popular enthusiasm."</p>

<p>"Shall you go out and see the procession?" continued
Fosdick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Dick; "I have been thinking of
another plan, which I think will be pleasanter."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a good while since we took an excursion.
Suppose we go to Fort Hamilton to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I should like that," said Fosdick. "I was
never there. How do we get there?"</p>

<p>"Cross over Fulton Ferry to Brooklyn, and there
we might take the cars to Fort Hamilton. It's
seven or eight miles out there."</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'might' take the cars?"</p>

<p>"Because the cars will be crowded with excursionists,
and I have been thinking we might hire a
carriage on the Brooklyn side, and ride out there in
style. It'll cost more money, but we don't often
take a holiday, and we can afford it for once. What
you do say, Mark?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean me to go?" asked Mark, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Of course I do. Do you think your guardian
would trust you to remain in the city alone?"</p>

<p>"I go in for your plan, Dick," said Fosdick.
"What time do you want to start?"</p>

<p>"About half-past nine o'clock. That will give
us plenty of time to go. Then, after exploring the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>

fort, we can get dinner at the hotel, and drive where
we please afterwards. I suppose there is sea-bathing
near by."</p>

<p>Dick's idea was unanimously approved, and by no
one more than by Mark. Holidays had been few
and far between with him, and he anticipated the excursion
with the most eager delight. He was only
afraid that the weather would prove unpropitious.
He was up at four, looking out of the window; but
the skies were clear, and soon the sun came out
with full radiance, dissipating the night-shadows, and
promising a glorious day.</p>

<p>Breakfast was later than usual, as people like to indulge
themselves in a little longer sleep on Sundays
and holidays; but it was over by half-past eight, and
within a few minutes from that time the three had
taken the cars to Fulton Ferry.</p>

<p>In about half an hour the ferry was reached, and,
passing through, the party went on board the boat.
They had scarcely done so, when an exclamation of
surprise was heard, proceeding from feminine lips,
and Dick heard himself called by name.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Hunter, this is an unexpected pleasure.
I am <em>so</em> glad to have met you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning his head, Dick recognized Mr. and Mrs.
Clifton. Both had been fellow-boarders with him in
Bleecker Street. The latter will be remembered by
the readers of "Fame and Fortune" as Miss Peyton.
When close upon the verge of old-maidenhood
she had been married, for the sake of a few thousand
dollars which she possessed, by Mr. Clifton, a clerk
on a small salary, in constant pecuniary difficulties.
With a portion of his wife's money he had purchased
a partnership in a dry-goods store on Eighth Avenue;
but the remainder of her money Mrs. Clifton had
been prudent enough to have settled upon herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifton still wore the same ringlets, and exhibited
the same youthful vivacity which had characterized
her when an inmate of Mrs. Browning's
boarding-house, and only owned to being twenty-four,
though she looked full ten years older.</p>

<p>"How d'e do, Hunter?" drawled Mr. Clifton,
upon whose arm his wife was leaning.</p>

<p>"Very well, thank you," said Dick. "I see
Mrs. Clifton is as fascinating as ever."</p>

<p>"O you wicked flatterer!" said Mrs. Clifton,
shaking her ringlets, and tapping Dick on the shoulder

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>

with her fan. "And here is Mr. Fosdick too,
I declare. How do you do, Mr. Fosdick?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you, Mrs. Clifton."</p>

<p>"I declare I've a great mind to scold you for not
coming round to see us. I should so much like to
hear you sing again."</p>

<p>"My friend hasn't sung since your marriage,
Mrs. Clifton," said Dick. "He took it very much
to heart. I don't think he has forgiven Clifton yet
for cutting him out."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunter is speaking for himself," said Fosdick,
smiling. "He has sung as little as I have."</p>

<p>"Yes, but for another reason," said Dick. "I
did not think it right to run the risk of driving
away the boarders; so, out of regard to my landlady,
I repressed my natural tendency to warble."</p>

<p>"I see you're just as bad as ever," said Mrs.
Clifton, in excellent spirits. "But really you must
come round and see us. We are boarding in West
Sixteenth Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues."</p>

<p>"If your husband will promise not to be jealous,
"said Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not subject to that complaint," said Clifton,
coolly. "Got a cigar about you, Hunter?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't smoke."</p>

<p>"No, don't you though? I couldn't get along
without it. It's my great comfort."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's always smoking," said Mrs. Clifton,
with some asperity. "Our rooms are so full of
tobacco smoke, that I don't know but some of my
friends will begin to think I smoke myself."</p>

<p>"A man must have some pleasure," said Clifton,
not appearing to be much discomposed by his wife's
remarks.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that although Mrs. Clifton
was always gay and vivacious in company, there
were times when she could display considerable ill-temper,
as her husband frequently had occasion to
know. Among the sources of difficulty and disagreement
was that portion of Mrs. Clifton's fortune
which had been settled upon herself, and of which
she was never willing to allow her husband the use
of a single dollar. In this, however, she had some
justification, as he was naturally a spendthrift, and,
if placed in his hands, it would soon have melted
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are you going, Mr. Hunter?" inquired
Mrs. Clifton, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Fosdick and I have planned to take a carriage
and ride to Fort Hamilton."</p>

<p>"Delightful!" said Mrs. Clifton. "Why can't
we go too, Mr. Clifton?"</p>

<p>"Why, to tell the plain truth," said her husband,
"I haven't got money enough with me. If you'll
pay for the carriage, I'm willing to go."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifton hesitated. She had money enough
with her, but was not inclined to spend it. Still the
prospect of making a joint excursion with Richard
Hunter and Fosdick was attractive, and she inquired:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How much will it cost?"</p>

<p>"About five dollars probably."</p>

<p>"Then I think we'll go," she said, "that is, if
our company would not be disagreeable to Mr. Hunter."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said Dick. "We will get
separate carriages, but I will invite you both to dine
with us after visiting the fort."</p>

<p>Mr. Clifton brightened up at this, and straightway
became more social and cheerful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifton," said Richard Hunter, "I believe
I haven't yet introduced you to my ward."</p>

<p>"Is that your ward?" inquired the lady, looking
towards Mark. "What is his name?"</p>

<p>"Mark Manton."</p>

<p>"How do you like your guardian?" inquired
Mrs. Clifton.</p>

<p>"Very much," said Mark, smiling.</p>

<p>"Then I won't expose him," said Mrs. Clifton.
"We used to be great friends before I married."</p>

<p>"Since that sad event I have never recovered my
spirits," said Dick. "Mark will tell you what a
poor appetite I have."</p>

<p>"Is that true, Mark?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's <em>very</em> poor," said Mark, with
a smile.</p>

<p>Probably my readers will not consider this conversation
very brilliant; but Mrs. Clifton was a silly
woman, who was fond of attention, and was incapable
of talking sensibly. Richard would have preferred
not to have her husband or herself in the
company, but, finding it inevitable, submitted to it
with as good a grace as possible.</p>

<p>Carriage were secured at a neighboring stable,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>

and the two parties started. The drive was found to
be very pleasant, particularly the latter portion, when
a fresh breeze from the sea made the air delightfully
cool. As they drove up beside the fort, they heard
the band within, playing a march, and, giving their
horses in charge, they were soon exploring the interior.
The view from the ramparts proved to be fine,
commanding a good view of the harbor and the city
of New York, nearly eight miles distant to the
north.</p>

<p>"It is a charming view," said Mrs. Clifton, with
girlish enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I know what will be more charming," said her
husband.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"A prospect of the dinner-table. I feel awfully
hungry."</p>

<p>"Mr. Clifton never thinks of anything but eating,"
said his wife.</p>

<p>"By Jove! you can do your share at that," retorted
her husband not very gallantly. "You'd
ought to see her eat, Hunter."</p>

<p>"I don't eat more than a little bird," said Mrs.
Clifton, affectedly. "I appeal to Mr. Hunter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"If any little bird ate as much as you, he'd
be sure to die of <i>dyspepsy</i>," said her husband. If
the word in italics is incorrectly spelled, I am not
responsible, as that is the way Mr. Clifton pronounced
it.</p>

<p>"I confess the ride has given me an appetite
also," said Dick. "Suppose we go round to the
hotel, and order dinner."</p>

<p>They were soon seated round a bountifully spread
dinner-table, to which the whole party, not excepting
Mrs. Clifton, did excellent justice. It will not
be necessary or profitable to repeat the conversation
which seasoned the repast, as, out of deference to
Mrs. Clifton's taste, none of the party ventured upon
any sensible remarks.</p>

<p>After dinner they extended their drive, and then
parted, as Mr. and Mrs. Clifton decided to make a
call upon some friends living in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>About four o'clock Richard Hunter and his friends
started on their return home. They had about
reached the Brooklyn city line, when Fosdick suddenly
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dick, there's a carriage overturned a little ways
ahead of us. Do you see it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Looking in the direction indicated, Dick saw that
Fosdick was correct.</p>

<p>"Let us hurry on," he said. "Perhaps we may
be able to render some assistance."</p>

<p>Coming up, they found that a wheel had come off,
and a gentleman of middle age was leaning against
a tree with an expression of pain upon his features,
while a boy of about seventeen was holding the
horse.</p>

<p>"Frank Whitney!" exclaimed Dick, in joyful
recognition.</p>

<p>To Frank Whitney Dick was indebted for the
original impulse which led him to resolve upon
gaining a respectable position in society, as will be
remembered by the readers of "Ragged Dick;" and
for this he had always felt grateful.</p>

<p>"Dick!" exclaimed Frank, in equal surprise.
"I am really glad to see you. You are a friend in
need."</p>

<p>"Tell me what has happened."</p>

<p>"The wheel of our carriage came off, as you see
and my uncle was pitched out with considerable
violence, and has sprained his ankle badly. I was
wondering what to do, when luckily you came up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me how I can help you," said Dick, promptly,
"and I will do so."</p>

<p>"We are stopping at the house of a friend in
Brooklyn. If you will give my uncle a seat in your
carryall, for he is unable to walk, and carry him
there, it will be a great favor. I will remain and
attend to the horse and carriage."</p>

<p>"With pleasure, Frank. Are you going to remain
in this neighborhood long?"</p>

<p>"I shall try to gain admission to the sophomore
class of Columbia College this summer, and shall
then live in New York, where I hope to see you
often. I intended to enter last year, but decided for
some reasons to delay a year. However, if I am admitted
to advanced standing, I shall lose nothing.
Give me your address, and I will call on you very
soon."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I shall inconvenience you," said
Mr. Whitney.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Dick, promptly. "We have
plenty of room, and I shall be glad to have an opportunity
of obliging one to whom I am indebted
for past kindness."</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney was assisted into the carriage, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
they resumed their drive, deviating from their
course somewhat, in order to leave him at the house
of the friend with whom he was stopping.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to have met Frank again,"
thought Dick: "I always liked him."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">Mark</span></span>
remained in the bookstore on the same
footing as before. He was not old enough to succeed
to Rowell's vacant place, but Mr. Baker, as a
mark of his satisfaction with him, and partly also to
compensate for the temporary suspicions which he
had entertained of his honesty, advanced his wages a
dollar a week. He therefore now received four dollars,
which yielded him no little satisfaction, as it
enabled him to pay a larger share of his expenses.</p>

<p>They were all seated in Richard Hunter's pleasant
room in St. Mark's Place one evening, when Dick
said suddenly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, Fosdick, I forgot to tell you
that I had a letter from Mr. Bates to-day."</p>

<p>"Did you? What does he say?"</p>

<p>"I will read it to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard drew the letter from the envelope, and
read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Hunter</span>:&mdash;I have received your letter,
reporting that you have as yet obtained no trace of my unfortunate
grandson, John Talbot. I thank you sincerely for your
kind and persistent efforts. I fear that he may have left New
York, possibly in the care of persons unfit to take charge of
him. It is a great source of anxiety to me lest he should be
suffering privation and bad treatment at this moment, when I,
his grandfather, have abundance of worldly means, and have it
in my power to rear him handsomely. I cannot help feeling
that it is a fitting punishment for the cruel harshness with
which I treated his mother. Now I am amassing wealth
but I have no one to leave it to. I feel that I have small
object in living. Yet I cannot give up the thought that my
grandson is still living. I cannot help indulging the hope
that some day, by the kind favor of Providence, he may be
given back to me.</p>

<p>"If it will not be too much trouble to you and Mr. Fosdick,
I shall feel indebted if you will still continue on the
watch for the lost boy. Any expenses which you may
incur, as I have already assured you, will be most cheerfully
paid by your obliged friend and servant,</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Hiram Bates</span>."<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Richard was reading this letter, Mark listened
attentively. Looking up, Richard observed this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you ever meet with a boy named John
Talbot, Mark?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No," said Mark, "not <em>John</em> Talbot."</p>

<p>"Did you ever meet any boy named Talbot?
It is not certain that the name is John."</p>

<p>"Talbot used to be my name," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Used to be your name!" exclaimed Richard, in
surprise. "I thought it was Manton."</p>

<p>"Some of the boys gave me that name, because
there was a story came out in one of the story papers
about Mark Manton. After a while I got to calling
myself so, but my real name is Mark Talbot."</p>

<p>"It would be strange if he should turn out to
be the right boy after all, Dick," said Fosdick.
"Where is the photograph? That will soon settle
the question."</p>

<p>Richard Hunter opened his desk, and took out the
card photograph which Mr. Bates had left with him.</p>

<p>"Mark," he said, "did you ever see any one who
looked like that picture?"</p>

<p>Mark took the picture in his hand. No sooner
did his eyes rest upon it than they filled with tears.</p>

<p>"That is my mother" he said. "Where did you
get it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your mother! Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I should know it anywhere, though it
looks younger than she did."</p>

<p>"Do you know what her name was, before she
was married?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she has told me often. It was Irene
Bates."</p>

<p>"How strange!" exclaimed Richard and Fosdick
together. "Mark," continued Richard, "I think
you are the very boy I had been in search of for
several months. I had succeeded without knowing
it."</p>

<p>"Please tell me all about it," said Mark. "I
don't understand."</p>

<p>"I have a great piece of good luck to announce
to you, Mark. Your grandfather is a rich man,
formerly in business in New York, but now a successful
merchant in Milwaukie. He has no child,
no descendant except yourself. He has been anxiously
seeking for you, intending to give you all the
advantages which his wealth can procure."</p>

<p>"Do you think I shall like him?" asked Mark,
timidly.</p>

<p>"Yes; I think he will be very kind to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"But he was not kind to my mother. Although
he was rich, he let her suffer."</p>

<p>"He has repented of this, and will try to make
up to you his neglect to your mother."</p>

<p>Mark was still thoughtful. "If it had come
sooner, my poor mother might still have been alive,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I think I had better telegraph to Mr. Bates
to-morrow," said Richard. "The news will be so
welcome that I don't like to keep it back a single
day."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will be better," said Fosdick. "You
will have to give up your ward, Dick."</p>

<p>"Yes; but as it will be for his good, I will not
object."</p>

<p>The next morning the following message was
flashed over the wires to Milwaukie:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Hiram Bates.</span></p>

<p>"Your grandson is found. He is well, and in my charge.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:15em;"><span class="smcap">"Richard Hunter."</span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the course of the forenoon, the following
answer was received:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard Hunter.</span></p>

<p>"How can I thank you! I take the next train for New
York.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:15em;"><span class="smcap">"Hiram Bates."</span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the afternoon succeeding, Mr. Bates entered
Richard's counting-room. He clasped his hand with
fervor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunter," he said, "I do not know how to
thank you. Where is my boy?"</p>

<p>"I am just going up to the house," said Richard.
"If you will accompany me, you shall soon see
him."</p>

<p>"I am impatient to hear all the particulars," said
Mr. Bates. "Remember, I know nothing as yet. I
only received your telegram announcing his discovery.
When did you find him?"</p>

<p>"That is the strangest part of it," said Richard.
"I found him sick just outside the office door several
weeks since. I took him home, and when he recovered
let him get a place in a bookstore; but, having
become interested in him, I was unwilling to lose
sight of him, and still kept him with me. All this
while I was searching for your grandson, and had
not the least idea that he was already found."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did you discover this at last?"</p>

<p>"By his recognition of his mother's photograph.
It was lucky you thought of leaving it with me."</p>

<p>"Is his name John?"</p>

<p>"He says his name is Mark, but for his last name
he had adopted a different one, or I should have
made the discovery sooner."</p>

<p>"How did he make a living before you found
him? Poor boy!" said Mr. Bates, sighing, "I
fear he must have suffered many privations."</p>

<p>"He was selling matches for some time,&mdash;what
we call a match boy. He had suffered hardships,
but I leave him to tell you his story himself."</p>

<p>"How does he feel about meeting me?" asked
Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>"You are a stranger to him, and he naturally feels
a little timid, but he will soon be reassured when he
gets acquainted with you."</p>

<p>Mark had already arrived. As they entered the
room, Mr. Bates said with emotion, "Is that he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Come here, Mark," he said, in a tone which took
away Mark's apprehension. "Do you know who I
am?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you my grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have come to take care of you, and to see
that you suffer no more from poverty."</p>

<p>Mr. Bates stooped down and pressed a kiss upon
the boy's forehead.</p>

<p>"I can see Irene's look in his eyes," he said.
"It is all the proof I need that he is my grandchild."</p>

<p>It was arranged that in three days, for he had some
business to transact, he should go back to Milwaukie
carrying Mark with him. He went round to Mr.
Baker's store the next morning with his grandson
and explained to him why he should be obliged to
withdraw him from his employ.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to lose him," said Mr. Baker. "He
is quick and attentive to his duties, and has given
me excellent satisfaction; but I am glad of his good
fortune."</p>

<p>"It gives me pleasure to hear so good an account
of him," said Mr. Bates. "Though he will be under
no necessity of taking another situation, but will for
several years devote himself to study, the same good
qualities for which you give him credit will insure
his satisfactory progress in school."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">CONCLUSION.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">It</span></span>
was not long before Mark felt quite at home
with his grandfather. He no longer felt afraid of
him, but began to look forward with pleasant anticipations
to his journey West, and the life that was to
open before him in Milwaukie. It was a relief to
think that he would not now be obliged to take care
of himself, but would have some one both able and
willing to supply his wants, and provide him with a
comfortable home.</p>

<p>He felt glad again that he was going to school.
He remembered how anxious his poor mother had
been that he should receive a good education, and
now his grandfather had promised to send him to the
best school in Milwaukie.</p>

<p>The next morning after their meeting, Mr. Bates
took Mark to a large clothing establishment, and
had him fitted out with new clothes in the most

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>

liberal manner. He even bought him a silver watch,
of which Mark felt very proud.</p>

<p>"Now, Mark," said his grandfather, "if there
is any one that was kind to you when you were a
poor match boy, I should like to do something to
show my gratitude for their kindness. Can you
think of any one?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark; "there's Ben Gibson."</p>

<p>"And who is Ben Gibson?"</p>

<p>"He blacks boots down on Nassau Street. When
I ran away from Mother Watson, who treated me so
badly, he stood by me, and prevented her from getting
hold of me again."</p>

<p>"Is there any one besides?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mark, after a pause; "there is Mrs.
Flanagan. She lives in the same tenement-house
where I used to. When I was almost starved she used
to give me something to eat, though she was poor
herself."</p>

<p>"I think we will call and see her first," said Mr.
Bates. "I am going to let you give her a hundred
dollars."</p>

<p>"She will be delighted," said Mark, his eyes

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>

sparkling with joy. "It will seem a fortune to her.
Let us go at once."</p>

<p>"Very well," said his grandfather. "Afterwards
we will try to find your friend Ben."</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that Mr. Bates was stopping
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel.</p>

<p>They took the University Place cars, which landed
them at the junction of Barclay Street and Broadway.
From thence it was but a short distance to
Vandewater Street, where Mark lived when first
introduced to the reader.</p>

<p>They climbed the broken staircase, and paused in
front of Mrs. Flanagan's door.</p>

<p>Mark knocked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanagan opened the door, and stared with
some surprise at her visitors.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, Mrs. Flanagan?" asked
Mark.</p>

<p>"Why, surely it isn't Mark, the little match
boy?" said Mrs. Flanagan, amazed.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. So you didn't know me?"</p>

<p>"And it's rale delighted I am to see you lookin'
so fine. And who is this gentleman?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is my grandfather, Mrs. Flanagan. I'm
going out West to live with him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanagan dropped a courtesy to Mr. Bates,
who said, "My good woman, Mark tells me that you
were kind to him when he stood in need of kindness."</p>

<p>"And did he say that?" said Mrs. Flanagan, her
face beaming with pleasure. "Shure it was little I
did for him, bein' poor myself; but that little he was
heartily welcome to, and I'm delighted to think he's
turned out so lucky. The ould woman trated him
very bad. I used to feel as if I'd like to break her
ould bones for her."</p>

<p>"Mark and I both want to thank you for your
kindness to him, and he has a small gift to give you."</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Mark, drawing from his pocket
a neat pocket-book, containing a roll of bills. "You'll
find a hundred dollars inside, Mrs. Flanagan," he
said. "I hope they will help you."</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars!" ejaculated Mrs. Flanagan,
hardly believing her ears. "Does this good gentleman
give me a hundred dollars!"</p>

<p>"No it is Mark's gift to you," said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>"It's rich I am with so much money," said the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>

good woman. "May the saints bless you both!
Now I can buy some clothes for the childer, and have
plenty left beside. This is a happy day entirely.
But won't you step in, and rest yourselves a bit?
It's a poor room, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Flanagan," said Mr. Bates,
"but we are in haste this morning. Whenever Mark
comes to New York he shall come and see you."</p>

<p>They went downstairs, leaving Mrs. Flanagan so
excited with her good fortune, that she left her work,
and made a series of calls upon her neighbors, in
which she detailed Mark's good fortune and her
own.</p>

<p>"Now we'll go and find your friend, Ben Gibson,"
said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>"I think we'll find him on Nassau Street," said
Mark.</p>

<p>He was right.</p>

<p>In walking down Nassau Street on the east side,
Mr. Bates was accosted by Ben himself.</p>

<p>"Shine yer boots?"</p>

<p>"How are you, Ben?" said Mark.</p>

<p>Ben stared in surprise till he recognized his old
companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blest if it aint Mark," he said. "How you're
gettin on!"</p>

<p>"Ben, this is my grandfather," said Mark.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a lucky chap," said Ben, enviously.
"I wish I could find a rich grandfather. I don't
believe I ever had a grandfather."</p>

<p>"How are you getting on, my lad?" inquired
Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>"Middlin'," said Ben. "I haven't laid by a
fortun' yet."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not. How do you like blacking
boots?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's other things I might like better,"
said Ben,&mdash;"such as bein' a rich merchant;
but that takes rather more capital than blackin'
boots."</p>

<p>"I see you are an original," said Mr. Bates,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Am I?" said Ben. "Well, I'm glad of it,
though I didn't know it before. I hope it aint anything
very bad."</p>

<p>"Mark says you treated him kindly when he lived
about the street."</p>

<p>"It wasn't much," said Ben.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to do something for you. What shall I
do?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Ben, "I should like a new brush.
This is most worn out."</p>

<p>"How would you like to go to Milwaukie with
Mark, if I will get you a place there?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?" said Ben, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"I haven't any money to pay for goin' out there."</p>

<p>"I will take care of that," said Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go," said Ben, "and I'm much
obliged to you. Mark, you're a brick, and so's
your grandfather. I never expected to have such
good luck."</p>

<p>"Then you must begin to make arrangements at
once. Mark, here is some money. You may go
with Ben, see that he takes a good bath, and then
buy him some clothes. I am obliged to leave
you to do it, as I must attend to some business
in Wall Street. I shall expect to see you both at
the Fifth Avenue Hotel at two o'clock."</p>

<p>At two o'clock, Mr. Bates found the two boys
awaiting him. There was a great change in Ben's
appearance. He had faithfully submitted to the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>

bath, and bloomed out in a tasteful suit of clothes,
selected by Mark. Mark had taken him besides to
a barber's and had his long hair cut. So he now
made quite a presentable appearance, though he felt
very awkward in his new clothes.</p>

<p>"It don't seem natural to be clean," he confessed
to Mark.</p>

<p>"You'll get used to it after a while," said Mark,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Maybe I will; but I miss my old clothes. They
seemed more comfortable."</p>

<p>The next day they were to start. Ben remained
at the hotel with his friend Mark, feeling, it must
be confessed, a curious sensation at his unusual position.</p>

<p>They went to make a farewell call on Richard
Hunter.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunter," said Mr. Bates, "money will not
pay you for the service you have done me, but I
shall be glad if you will accept this cheque."</p>

<p>Richard saw that it was a cheque for a thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your liberality, Mr. Bates" he
said; "but I do not deserve it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me be the judge of that."</p>

<p>"I will accept it on one condition."</p>

<p>"Name it, Mr. Hunter."</p>

<p>"That you will allow me to give it to the Newsboys'
Lodge, where I once found shelter, and where
so many poor boys are now provided for."</p>

<p>"I will give an equal sum to that institution,"
said Mr. Bates, "and I thank you for reminding me
of it. As for this money, oblige me by keeping it
yourself."</p>

<p>"Then," said Richard, "I will keep it as a charity
fund, and whenever I have an opportunity of
helping along a boy who is struggling upward as I
once had to struggle, I will do it."</p>

<p>"A noble resolution, Mr. Hunter! You have
found out the best use of money."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mark is now at an excellent school in Milwaukie,
pursuing his studies. He is the joy and solace of
his grandfather's life, hitherto sad and lonely, and is
winning the commendation of his teachers by his devotion
to study. A place was found for Ben Gibson,
where he had some advantages of education, and he
is likely to do well. He has been persuaded by

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>

Mark to leave off smoking,&mdash;a habit which he had
formed in the streets of New York. The shrewdness
which his early experiences taught him will be likely
to benefit him in the business career which lies before
him.</p>

<p>Every year Mark sends a substantial present to
Mrs. Flanagan, under his grandfather's direction, and
thus makes the worthy woman's life much more comfortable
and easy. From time to time Mark receives
a letter from Richard Hunter, who has not lost his
interest in the little match boy who was once his
ward.</p>

<p>So the trials of Mark, the Match Boy, as far as
they proceeded from poverty and privation, are at an
end. He has found a comfortable and even luxurious
home, and a relative whose great object in life is to
study his happiness. I hope that the record of his
struggles will be read with interest by my young
readers, and shall hope to meet them all again in the
next volume of this series, which will be called:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large"><b>HORATIO ALGER, JR.</b></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> enormous sales of the books of Horatio Alger, Jr.,
show the greatness of his popularity among the boys, and
prove that he is one of their most favored writers. I am told
that more than half a million copies altogether have been
sold, and that all the large circulating libraries in the country
have several complete sets, of which only two or three volumes
are ever on the shelves at one time. If this is true,
what thousands and thousands of boys have read and are
reading Mr. Alger's books! His peculiar style of stories,
often imitated but never equaled, have taken a hold upon the
young people, and, despite their similarity, are eagerly read
as soon as they appear.</p>

<p>Mr. Alger became famous with the publication of that
undying book, "Ragged Dick, or Street Life in New York."
It was his first book for young people, and its success was so
great that he immediately devoted himself to that kind of
writing. It was a new and fertile field for a writer then, and
Mr. Alger's treatment of it at once caught the fancy of the
boys. "Ragged Dick" first appeared in 1868, and ever since
then it has been selling steadily, until now it is estimated
that about 200,000 copies of the series have been sold.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>A writer for boys should have an abundant sympathy
with them. He should be able to enter into their plans,
hopes, and aspirations. He should learn to look upon life
as they do. Boys object to be written down to. A boy's
heart opens to the man or writer who understands him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large">HOW I CAME TO WRITE MY FIRST BOOK.</span><br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I was sixteen years old I belonged to a composition
class. It was our custom to go on the recitation seat
every day with clean slates, and we were allowed ten minutes
to write seventy words on any subject the teacher
thought suited to our capacity. One day he gave out "What
a Man Would See if He Went to Greenland." My heart was
in the matter, and before the ten minutes were up I had one
side of my slate filled. The teacher listened to the reading
of our compositions, and when they were all over he simply
said: "Some of you will make your living by writing one
of these days." That gave me something to ponder upon.
I did not say so out loud, but I knew that my composition
was as good as the best of them. By the way, there was
another thing that came in my way just then. I was reading
at that time one of Mayne Reid's works which I had
drawn from the library, and I pondered upon it as much as
I did upon what the teacher said to me. In introducing
Swartboy to his readers he made use of this expression:
"No visible change was observable in Swartboy's countenance."
Now, it occurred to me that if a man of his education
could make such a blunder as that and still write a
book, I ought to be able to do it, too. I went home that very
day and began a story, "The Old Guide's Narrative," which
was sent to the <cite>New York Weekly</cite>, and came back, respectfully
declined. It was written on both sides of the sheets
but I didn't know that this was against the rules. Nothing
abashed, I began another, and receiving some instruction,
from a friend of mine who was a clerk in a book store, I
wrote it on only one side of the paper. But mind you, he
didn't know what I was doing. Nobody knew it; but one

day, after a hard Saturday's work&mdash;the other boys had been
out skating on the brick-pond&mdash;I shyly broached the subject
to my mother. I felt the need of some sympathy. She
listened in amazement, and then said: "Why, do you think
you could write a book like that?" That settled the matter,
and from that day no one knew what I was up to until I sent
the first four volumes of Gunboat Series to my father. Was
it work? Well, yes; it was hard work, but each week I had
the satisfaction of seeing the manuscript grow until the
"Young Naturalist" was all complete.</p>

<h2>EDWARD S. ELLIS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward S. Ellis</span>, the popular writer of boys' books, is
a native of Ohio, where he was born somewhat more than a
half-century ago. His father was a famous hunter and rifle
shot, and it was doubtless his exploits and those of his associates,
with their tales of adventure which gave the son his
taste for the breezy backwoods and for depicting the stirring
life of the early settlers on the frontier.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis began writing at an early age and his work was
acceptable from the first. His parents removed to New
Jersey while he was a boy and he was graduated from the
State Normal School and became a member of the faculty
while still in his teens. He was afterward principal of the
Trenton High School, a trustee and then superintendent of
schools. By that time his services as a writer had become
so pronounced that he gave his entire attention to literature.
He was an exceptionally successful teacher and wrote a number
of text-books for schools, all of which met with high
favor. For these and his historical productions, Princeton
College conferred upon him the degree of Master of Arts.</p>

<p>The high moral character, the clean, manly tendencies
and the admirable literary style of Mr. Ellis' stories have
made him as popular on the other side of the Atlantic as in
this country. A leading paper remarked some time since,
that no mother need hesitate to place in the hands of her boy
any book written by Mr. Ellis. They are found in the leading
Sunday-school libraries, where, as may well be believed,
they are in wide demand and do much good by their sound,
wholesome lessons which render them as acceptable to parents
as to their children. All of his books published by Henry
T. Coates &amp; Co. are re-issued in London, and many have
been translated into other languages. Mr. Ellis is a writer
of varied accomplishments, and, in addition to his stories, is
the author of historical works, of a number of pieces of popular

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>

music and has made several valuable inventions. Mr.
Ellis is in the prime of his mental and physical powers, and
great as have been the merits of his past achievements, there
is reason to look for more brilliant productions from his pen
in the near future.</p>

<h2>J. T. TROWBRIDGE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="large"><span class="smcap">Neither</span></span> as a writer does he stand apart from the great
currents of life and select some exceptional phase or odd
combination of circumstances. He stands on the common
level and appeals to the universal heart, and all that he suggests
or achieves is on the plane and in the line of march of
the great body of humanity.</p>

<p>The Jack Hazard series of stories, published in the late
<cite>Our Young Folks</cite>, and continued in the first volume of <cite>St.
Nicholas</cite>, under the title of "Fast Friends," is no doubt
destined to hold a high place in this class of literature. The
delight of the boys in them (and of their seniors, too) is
well founded. They go to the right spot every time. Trowbridge
knows the heart of a boy like a book, and the heart
of a man, too, and he has laid them both open in these books
in a most successful manner. Apart from the qualities that
render the series so attractive to all young readers, they
have great value on account of their portraitures of American
country life and character. The drawing is wonderfully
accurate, and as spirited as it is true. The constable, Sellick,
is an original character, and as minor figures where will
we find anything better than Miss Wansey, and Mr. P. Pipkin,
Esq. The picture of Mr. Dink's school, too, is capital,
and where else in fiction is there a better nick-name than
that the boys gave to poor little Stephen Treadwell, "Step
Hen," as he himself pronounced his name in an unfortunate
moment when he saw it in print for the first time in his lesson
in school.</p>

<p>On the whole, these books are very satisfactory, and
afford the critical reader the rare pleasure of the works that
are just adequate, that easily fulfill themselves and accomplish
all they set out to do.&mdash;<cite>Scribner's Monthly.</cite></p>

<p><b>THE BIBLE MADE FASCINATING TO CHILDREN.</b>&mdash;The heroes and the
noble men and women of the Bible are made to appear as
living, acting people. The book is an original work, and
in no sense an imitation. It has been in preparation for
a number of years.</p>

<p><b>THE DISTINGUISHED AUTHOR.</b>&mdash;Dr. Hurlbut has long been associated
with, and director of, the Sunday School work of
one of the largest denominations, and he has been more
closely associated with the detail work of the Chautauqua
movement than has any other man. He is also well known
as a writer.</p>

<p><b>REMARKABLE FOR THE BEAUTY AND NUMBER OF ITS ILLUSTRATIONS.</b>&mdash;There
are sixteen pictures in color prepared for this work
by the distinguished artist, W. H. Margetson, and reproduced
with the beauty and attractiveness of the artist's
original work. There are also <b>nearly 200 half-tone</b> engravings
in this remarkable book, which is as original in
the selection of its illustrations as it is in its stories.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
